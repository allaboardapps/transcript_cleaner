Everybody's heard
the old joke,

"How do you get to
Carnegie Hall?"

"Practice, man.
Practice."

Well, like most people
I did all my practicing

at home in my own
neighborhood.

I grew up on the Upper
West Side in New York City.

General Grant was
one of my neighbors.

I had a lot of fun
in my neighborhood.

I did a lot of practicing,
and sooner or later,

I just wanted to
get downtown

to show what I could do

and I had to find out
how to get there.

In New York City, if you don't
know how to get somewhere,

all you gotta do
is ask somebody:

They'll tell you even
if they don't know.

Hey, tell me somethin',
you got a second?

Uh-huh.

How do you get to
Carnegie Hall?

I don't know.
I really couldn't tell you.

Yeah, are you from
'round here?

Oh, yeah.
I live right there!

I don't even know
where I am now.

How am I gonna tell you
how to get to Carnegie Hall?

How do you get to
Carnegie Hall?

From here?

Well, no,
from the moon.

Take the bus upon
the corner there,

down to 57th street,
get off there.

It's a block walk.

Can I take the
subway here?

Got a gun permit?

Take the plane.

Take the plane?

The 59th street plane?

Well, that depends on
which way you wanna go.

Well, all I can say is you
can take a car down there.

Take the bus.

It'll leave you
right in front of there.

OK.

I don't know the number,
but I'll get there.

Jump on a cab.

You tell the man to
take you downtown.

If you got no bread,
just jump out.

How you get to
Carnegie Hall?

Yeah.

Well, if you don't have a car,
you use the subway.

And then if you
don't have money,

you hop the turnstile.

Then if you for real
you go to court.

As you can see,

not everybody agrees
on how to get there.

Now, when I was a kid,

if you wanted to get
somewhere,

you had to take whatever
ride was available.

I believe my ride
has just arrived.

Hi there!
How are you?

Hi-ya doing?

Hi-ya doing?
Good evening, everybody!

Hello there.
Thank you.

Thanks a lot.

Have you noticed that most
women who are against abortion

are women that you wouldn't
wanna fuck in the first place?

Thank you very much,
Ladies and gentlemen.

Good evening.
My name is George Carlin

and I am a
professional comedian

as opposed to the kind you run
into at work all day long.

It's nice,
being a comedian.

There are certain
advantages, naturally,

and a few disadvantages.

There are some drawbacks
to being a comedian.

No one on death row
has ever said,

"Before I die, I wanna
talk to a comedian!"

Have you ever heard anyone at
the scene of an accident say,

"Quick! Call a comedian
for God's sake!"

But, it would be kind of
fun at an accident

to push your way through
the crowd and say,

"May I be of help?
I am a professional comedian!"

And sooner or later at
least once in your life

when the policeman
says to you,

"What are you,
a comedian?"

You've got to look him
right in the eye and say,

"Actually, yes!"

Even the criminals have
no respect for comedians.

What do they say first thing
they do when they hold you up?

"Don't try anything funny!

The first one makes a
funny move, gets it!"

Whenever they're not
looking, I go...

Well, that's my job!
Thinking of goofy shit!

Thinking of goofy shit, coming
around every now and then,

letting you know what it is

or reminding you of
things you already know

but forgot to laugh at the
first time they happened.

We all have
things like that!

You hear them, then you
don't remember at all!

For instance, I've noticed
they have disposable douches

and I'm wondering

who would wanna keep it
in the first place?

I do have a lot...not a lot but
I have some notes over here

and the reason for that is I
haven't been doing this lately.

I wanna make sure I know and
remember everything tonight.

I've been taking
little time off.

About six months,
I think,

I took three of them
quite voluntarily,

and the other three
quite against my will.

I had a heart attack,

or as they say in Boston,
"I had a heart attack."

"He had a heart attack.
Do you hear that, George?

He had a goddamn
myocardial infarction."

"I had a heart attack.

Fortunately,
my pharmacist,

my cardiologist
and my doctor

gave me CPR."

But I would like to
bring you up to date

on the comedian's
health sweepstakes.

As it stands right now,

I lead Richard Pryor
in heart attacks

two to one.

I am ahead.
That's right.

Now, however, Richard still
leads me one to nothing

on burning yourself up.

Well, what happened was, first,
Richard had a heart attack

then I had a heart attack,

then Richard burned
himself up.

Then I said fuck that.

I'm going to have
another heart attack.

I had an interesting morning,
got into an argument...

Got into an argument
with my Rice Krispies.

I distinctly heard,
"Snap, crackle, fuck him!"

I don't know which
one of them said it.

I was reaching for the
artificial sweetener

and was not looking
directly into the bowl,

but I told them,
I said,

"Well, you can all just sit
right there in the milk!

As far as I'm concerned,
you can sit in the milk

until I find out which
one of you said that!"

A little mass punishment
for my breakfast food.

The idea is to turn them
against one another,

"Just sit in the milk as
far as I'm concerned!"

Silly me.

Big punishment.
That's what they do anyway.

Sit in the milk.

That's their job.

That's Rice Krispies' job.
Sitting in the milk.

You've seen them,
haven't you?

Floating along,

little beige blisters of air,

riding proudly in the milk,

but you can't sink them.
They float for a long time.

Do you know why?
They stay together.

They gather together
in little groups.

Little groups of 8, 10, 12,
sometimes 14,

but always an even
number if you've noticed.

It's the polarity of the
Krispies that attracts them.

They form little colonies
of Rice Krispies.

But you can't sink them!

You try to sink
them with a spoon,

they come up
over the sides.

You can't sink them.
That's what the fruit is for.

Sinking the Rice Krispies.

A good-sized peach will
take down 80 or 90 of them.

If I'm really pissed,

I'll drop a
watermelon on them.

But I say interesting about my
morning 'cause it was...

I don't have
a nice day anymore.

I don't bother
much with that.

I think I'm beyond that now.

I think I've outgrown
the nice day.

I think I've had my share.

Why should I be hugging
all the really nice ones?

Let somebody else
have a few.

Of course, everybody
still wants me to have one.

Everybody wants me
to have a nice day.

Have a nice day!

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Wanna give me my
fucking change, please?

I'm triple parked!

Some of them are
really insistent.

"I SAID HAVE A NICE DAY!"

Alright. Alright goddamnit.
I'll give it a shot!

That's the trouble with
"Have a nice day!"

It puts all the
pressure on you.

Now you've gotta go out
and somehow manage

to have a good time!

All because of some
loose-lip cashier.

Have a nice day.

Maybe I don't feel like
having a nice day.

Maybe, just maybe,

I've had 116
nice days in a row!

And I'm ready, by God,
for a crappy day!

I never hear that!
Let them wish one of them!

Hey, have a crappy day!

Thank you, and to your
wonderful family as well!

A crappy day!
Hey, that'll be easy!

It's no trouble at all!
A crappy day,

just get up!

There's no planning
involved for a crappy day!

I know what it is that bothers
me about that whole thing.

It's the word nice.

It's just a weak word.

Doesn't have a lot of
character, you know?

Nice!

Isn't he nice?

Oh, he's so nice,

and she is nice, too!

Isn't that nice?

How nice they are!

I never cared for that,
you know?

It's like fine.

There's another word!
How are you?

Fine!

Bullshit!

Nobody's fine!

Hair is fine.

How's your hair?
Fine!

That makes a lot
more sense to me!

Some guys are great!

Ever meet those guys?
Great!

Isn't this great?

Goddamn, this is great!

Look, they're
gonna kill that guy!

Isn't that great?

That's great!

No, not me,
I'm not nice.

I'm not fine.

I'm not great.

People ask me how I am.
I say I'm fairly decent.

I don't get too
many superlatives,

nothing to gossip about.

Relatively OK!

Sometimes I'll say,
"I'm moderately neeto!"

If I'm in a particularly
jaunty mood,

I'll say, "I'm not unwell.
Thank you."

That pisses them off,

'cause they have to figure
that one out for themselves.

So...

It reminds me of something
my first grade teacher

used to say to me.

A little lady.

She used to say,

"You show me a
tropical fruit,

and I'll show you a
cocksucker from Guatemala."

No, that was someone else.
That was someone else.

I think it was someone
I met in the army.

I always confuse them.
I don't know what it is.

Have you ever been looking
through the refrigerator

and come across
an empty plate?

Well, that starts
me to wondering.

Did something eat
something else?

Maybe the olives
ate the peas!

Maybe the chicken
isn't really dead!

And he's grazing
on my stuff!

Actually, I picture
a little mouse

with gloves and a
parka on, you know?

Just waiting for the
lights to go out

so it can get back to work.

I guess the worst thing that
can happen cleaning out

or looking through
the refrigerator

is to come across something

that you cannot
identify at all!

You literally do not
know what it is!

It could be meat.

It could be cake!

Usually,
at a time like that,

I'll bluff.

Honey?

Is this good?

Well, what is it?

I don't know!

I've never seen
anything like it!

It looks like meat-cake!

Well, smell it!

Actually, it has no
smell whatsoever!

It's good!

Put it back!

Somebody is saving it!

It'll turn up in something!

That what's frightens me!

I was what they called
a "fussy eater".

He is fussy.

He is a fussy eater.

Fussy eater is an euphemism
for big pain in the ass!

I mean, if I didn't like
something I told them.

I didn't play with my food.

Picked up my food and said,
"I don't like that!"

You make this?

I don't like it!

Why?

They wanted reasons.

Well, you don't always
have a reason!

I don't know!

I know I don't like it!

And I know that if I ate it,
I would like it even less!

You like it,
you eat it!

Then, they would try to
corner me with logic.

How do you know
you don't like it

if you've never even tried?

It came to me in a dream!

Big pain in the ass!

Some things I didn't like just
because the sound of the food!

And to this day,
I can still not eat

"yoghurt!"

Yog- Yoghurt!

It sounds like
it's coming up again!

Yog- Yoghurt!

I can't eat anything with
a "Y" and a "G" in it.

Something else that
doesn't sound so good.

Squash!

You want some squash?

Shit, no!

Sounds like somebody
sat on my dinner!

Succotash!

You want some succotash?

What did you call me?
You fuck!

Look out!
Heh!"

Come on...hey, hey,
fucking cool out!

Hey, it's fucking
beans and corn!

Cool out!
Cool out!"

Wheat germ.

No, get it off my plate!

Even something like
eggplant!

Well, which one is it,
anyway?

Tell it to make up its mind
and then come on back!

Terrible sounding food.

Head cheese.

Uh! Uh! Uh!

I can't even look
at the sign!

I'll be down near
the bolognese!

You look at it!"

Between head cheese
and blood tongue,

I may never eat again!

Certainly, it won't be
at the Deli!

Then there are some foods
that sound too humorous to eat.

Did you hear something
too funny to eat?

Guacamole.

Sounds like something
you wear to a dance!

May I borrow your
green Guacamole?

Garbanzo.

Hey, want some
garbanzo's?

That sounds like
a circus act!

Ladies and gentlemen,
the Garbanzo's!

And the funniest
food of all time,

kumquats.

I don't bring them
home anymore!

Just go to waste.

Some things
don't look right.

I don't like that, Ma!

Don't look right to me!

Did you make that?

Is there a picture of
it in the cookbook?

I bet it don't
look like that!

Let's face it!
Be honest!

Some things
don't look right!

Of course, some people
will eat anything.

I know that!
Some guys eat anything!

I saw those guys in the
army on the chow line!

What's this?
Never mind!

Gimme a whole lot of it!

That's rat's asshole, Don!

Well, it certainly makes
a hell of a fondue!

I don't eat anything
I don't recognize immediately!

If I have to ask
questions, fuck it!

I pass, you know?

Tomatoes don't
look right, either.

On the outside,
they're fine...

Tomatoes look lovely
on the outside!

But you look inside a tomato
and something is wrong.

Something is gone afoul
inside of a tomato!

It doesn't look right,
you know?

It doesn't look like it's
finished yet, for one thing.

It looks like it's in the
larval stage or something!

It's thousands of seeds

and a whole bunch of
jelly-looking stuff!

Get it off my plate!

It's gushy!

It's like the stuff
at the end of an egg.

And I know it's not
the end of an egg.

It's the beginning
of a chicken!

It's hen cum!

Get it off my plate!

It don't look right.

Something else that
doesn't look like food.

Lobsters and crabs!

I mean, anything coming
at me walking sideways

with big pinchers

somehow doesn't
make me hungry!

In fact, my instinct is,
"Step on that fuck!"

Look at the big bug!

Step on the big bug

before it gets to
the children!

They looked like he
meant business.

Can't order frog legs
in a restaurant.

I keep wondering what do they
do with the rest of the frog!

What do they do?

They give them
little dollies

and send them back out
into the world to beg?

Try!

Try to return them to a
normal life if you can!

Trouble is the
"dollies for froggies"

program has been
cut in half.

You've probably seen the
last "froggy-dolly"

for a long, long time...

I'd rather eat a
box of cookies.

Doesn't that always
come in handy?

Just eat a goddamn
box of cookies!

Do you ever do that?

A whole box of cookies,
right in a row!

I don't mean you
take them out.

I mean eat them
in the kitchen!

Standing right in
the kitchen,

eat a whole goddamn
box of cookies!

Just stare at the electric
clock while you're eating them!

Did you ever notice,
right on the cookies it says,

"Open here"?

What the fuck do they
think you're gonna do?

Move to Hong Kong to
open up their cookies?

Of course you're
going to open them here!

You're going to
eat them here!

You almost have
to open them here!

Thank God it doesn't say,
"Open somewhere else!"

Shit!
I'd be up all night

trying to find a
good location.

Got a little news for you.

Let's take a look at
the news tonight

and see what's going on.

Ladies and gentlemen,
here is some of the news.

The US Army
announced today

that it was true that during
the first part of the 1960's,

they had performed LSD
test on human beings

which destroyed their minds.

However, they've claimed
that none of the victims

has been promoted

beyond the rank of
lieutenant colonel!

A man who was attempting
to walk around the world

drowned today!

Twenty-six people
were killed today

when two funeral
processions

crashed into one another.

Police say they casualty
list does not include

the two men who
were already dead.

Another first for
County Hospital

as a woman has checked in
to have her tits reversed!

When asked why she
was having it done,

she said that her
left tit was her favorite

and she wants it
on her right side

where her left-handed husband
can reach it easily.

The ASPCA announced today

that they have filed
a criminal complaint

against a man who was
keeping tropical fish

in a moving blender!

The man says it is true,

but that he never turns
the blender above mix.

ASPCA claims

he's had it up to whip
and pur�e several times!

A passenger shot six people
on the downtown bus today

then asked for a transfer

and shot six people on
the crosstown bus!

In order to prevent this
happening in the future,

authorities are discontinuing
the transfer system!

Here are the results of the
Blind Persons' Golf Tournament.

They've just come in.

The winner was
Johnny Downing

with 1,829 strokes

just enough to beat
Larry Powell

who lost any chance
he may have had

when he took a 312
on the final hole!

A 65-year-old woman

who was trotting backwards
from Winnipeg to Rio

was killed today when
she was hit by a truck

head on from the rear!

A small town in Tennessee

just downwind from
a nuclear plant

believes it may have
received some radiation.

Everyone is dead and
the trees are humming!

Although the Internal
Revenue Service

has begun to crack
down on businessmen

for the
"Three Martini Lunch",

they will not bother
the working men

and the two-joint
coffee break.

A man who was attempting
to circle the world

in a hot-air balloon
died today

when he stepped
out of the balloon

to admire it
from a distance!

A spokesman for the
Reagan Administration

has said that many dead
people are really only sick

and trying to collect
illegal death benefits!

On the lighter side
of the news,

a couple who was celebrating
their 90th wedding anniversary

died of shock today at the
beginning of a surprise party!

Well, to kind of wind
up the news tonight,

there's so often so
much death and tragedy,

a man in Texas was
arrested today

for shooting and
killing his wife,

son, two daughters,
his mother and father,

all four of his
grandparents,

his dog,
his mailman,

three neighbors,

and a woman who works
at the filling station!

He claims he was just
cleaning his gun

when it suddenly went off!

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

Have you noticed that you
never seem to get laid

on Thanksgiving?

I think that's because all
the coats are on the bed!

Do you realize that
the Mexican Hat Dance

was written by two
individuals?

A lot of folks
don't know that!

The first guy
wrote tara-tara-tara,

and the second guy wrote
tararara-tara.

If it weren't for
that second guy,

the Mexican Hat Dance
would have gone

tara-tara-tara,
tara-tara-tara,

tara-tara-tara,
tara-tara-tara,

tara-tara-tara.

They were so happy with
what they had discovered

that they went out to celebrate,
and they met another guy,

and he went talala,
talala, talala, talala...

Sometimes it takes three.

This is the musical
portion of our show.

You know what bothers me?

Eh.

You know what...is that me?
Yes, it is.

You know what bothers me?

I can never find out
the rest of the words to

"ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay!"

Everybody knows
"ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay..."

I did find them out.

Someone sent them to me,
ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay,

did you get yours today?

I got mine yesterday.

That's why I walk this way!

Now, how can you
tell when a moth farts?

He flies in a straight line!

(fart sound)

Do you realize that
somewhere in the world

is the worst doctor?

Has to be!

Process of elimination,

sooner or later you're gonna
find the worst doctor!

And the weird part is

that someone has
an appointment

to see him tomorrow!

I know, you're just
trying to butter me up.

Don't give me that shit!

Yes,
in goddamn deed!

I love that dog!

I've never seen him
and I love him.

It's gonna be wonderful
when I meet that dog!

Hey, you wanna dog?

You want a goddamn dog?

Go ahead, man.
You can have a dog.

I have three of them, man!

You want a fucking dog?

Grab it, man.
It's yours!

Lots of people got
lots of goddamn doggies!

You don't even have to have
one to learn about doggies.

Your friend may
have a dog!

It could be your
friend's dog!

That makes him
your dog-friend!

You go to visit your friend!
His dog is there

and you'd pet him too!

Hi! Hello?
How are you, Sneezy?

You're wonderful!
Hello!

Goddamn, for that
moment he's your dog!

So you can have someone
else's dog for a while!

"Hi.
He likes me I think.

Oh my god, look at
this doggie here!

Goddamn doggies!

Lots of things to know
about them, too.

Lots of things you learn.

You don't know where always
and you can't remember!

For instance, can you remember
the first time you found out

that by scratching
a dog here,

you can make this
leg go like that?

And that you can make
it stop when you stop!

Goddamn!

I'm in complete
control of this dog!

Or that you can make their head
tilt from across the room

just by making a
funny noise?

You go (sound).

And he goes...

Oh look, honey!
Isn't he cute?

Let's get his head fixed
so he stays like that!

Oh, you get the
heads done!

It'll cost you a bundle
and they don't like it!

Makes them move to the
same side all the time!

Cute little goddamn doggie!

Do you ever eat candy
right in front of your dog?

I don't mean a Milky Way.

I mean one-at-a-time candy,
like M&M's,

and you watch
where he's looking!

He's following
your fingertips!

Oh, boy!

This asshole drops
one Jujubee,

I'm going for his
femoral artery!

Do you ever spell in
front of your dog?

Some of them are smart.

You got to spell.

Honey, do we anymore
B-O-N-E-S?

They know the
sound of B alone.

B - bone.
Bone, bone bone...

Take it easy.
Take it easy.

There are all kinds of dogs.

There are all sizes
of dogs, too.

There's a lot of
goddamn big dogs.

You know, big dogs?
I don't mean big.

I don't mean a big dog.
I mean a fuckin' big dog.

Some people has got
goddamn big doggies.

Look like they ought
to have

commercial license
plate on them.

Livestock dogs.

What the hell is that?

That's my dog.

He blacked out the sun!

That's tiny.

Little dogs are different!

Little dogs will get
around and do fine.

He'll jump all he wants.

I don't know how
they jump so high?

They got little
teeny legs like this.

They got legs.

If you feel a
little dog's leg

it feels like a
beef jerky in there!

They can jump up on the
bed all they want to.

Holy God!
Do that again!

Oh, man!
One more time!

I make him keep doin' it
until he can't reach anymore!

Then, if I want him up there,
I'll put him up there!

And sooner or later,
what's gonna happen

with the little dog?

Sooner or later,
lying on the bed,

he's gonna create
an incident.

He's gonna make one
of you humans turn

to the other and say...

Honey, did you fart?

Not me!

I thought you farted!

Not me!

That's not even
one of my farts!

I've got four farts,
and that's not one of mine!

I've got my Heineken's fart.

I've got my broccoli fart.

My rice pudding fart

and my nondairy
creamer fart!

And that's not
one of my farts!

I know.

The dog farted!

Tippy, why did you fart?

Look at him!
He knows he farted!

I've seen his
asshole open up!

I've seen it!

Well, I happened to be looking
at his asshole by chance!

What kind of a
question is that?

I thought he was doing them
deep breathing exercises.

You see, dogs
have nothing to do?

There's no job
description for a dog!

They're forced to wait
for something to happen

that they can get it on!

If you do something,
they'll be glad to join you!

They rarely initiate any
activity on their own!

They're just waiting,
waiting.

Waiting and waiting
and waiting.

Waiting to come in,
waiting to go out,

waiting to eat,
waiting to crap,

waiting to wake up,
waiting to sleep,

waiting to go upstairs,
waiting to go downstairs.

Sometimes they're
just waiting to wait!

Have you ever seen a
dog just standing there?

He don't know what
he's waiting for,

but if it happens,
he'll be ready!

Just waiting and waiting.

Waiting for you
to come home.

They don't understand time.

Dog doesn't know the
difference between

an hour and a half
or next week.

He thinks you're
gonna be gone forever!

That's the only time period
dogs really understand,

forever.

That's how long they
think everything lasts!

That's how long they
think everything takes!

Forever and ever!

You scratch your dog
behind the ears!

Oh, boy!
They love that!

Oh, boy, you're
scratching your doggy

behind the ears and
he really loves that

and you look at him
and everything,

and he really loves it,
and when you finally stop

he looks at you like
you're a criminal!

He thought it was gonna
go on and on and on.

Same thing when
you feed them.

Soon as they get
finished, they say,

"Where the fuck's
the food?"

They thought it was the
loaves and the fishes!

They were gonna
last forever and ever!

A dog don't know.

They must think we're
gonna be gone forever.

Otherwise, why do they
act they way they do

when we finally get home?

Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!

Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!

Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!"

I thought you'd never
come home!

I thought you'd
never come home!

I thought you'd never
come home!

I thought you'd
never come home!

"I didn't know what to do!
You know what?

I don't know how to
operate a can opener!

I don't know how to
operate a can opener!

I didn't know what
to do, man!

Push it down?
I couldn't think!

You know what?
You know what I did?

I took a can of dog food
and rolled it down the hill

and hoped a truck
ran it over!

That's all I could
think of, man.

I mean,

they'll do that even
if you just forgot your hat!

You come back in
eight seconds.

Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!

I thought you'd
never come home!

I was gonna eat the bird!

I couldn't find the bird!
Where the fuck's the bird?

Will you stop it?
I was just here!"

God, they get you
mad sometimes!

Don't they?

Do you ever get
mad at your dog?

You feel really dumb when
you get all the way to work

and you're still pissed
at your pet!

What's the matter, Dan?

Well, the dog...

Goddamn it!
Never mind!

He chewed the legs
off everything!

OK,
I'll see you at lunch!

Dog don't care.

He'll do whatever was next!

He don't know what's next,
but he'll do something!

They'll do things in a row
that don't go together!

Have you ever seen a dog
walking through a room

and suddenly he stops

and chews his back
for 18 minutes?

And then when he's
finished chewing

as if it was scheduled
for right then!

When he's finished,

he doesn't even know
where he was gonna go!

Where was I gonna go?

Oh, shit!

Oh, I think I'll
go over here!

Oh, this is nice
over here.

I think I'll keep
coming over here!

He don't know.
He don't care!

Dog don't care!

Like I said,
he'll do anything.

He might embarrass you.

He might do something
inappropriate

when you have company.

You might have some
folks in visiting you.

Some of them you
don't know that well

trying to impress
a couple of them.

Hey, you might be
trying to borrow money

off one of these studs!

Dog's lying out there
in the living room,

you got all these
people sitting 'round,

you got little chips,
little dip.

Dog's in full view
of everyone!

Got carrot sticks,
salty sticks, ladyfingers,

finger ladies, all sort of
little things that you got.

Everybody is eating nicely,

and you look down
and you realize

that the dog is
licking his balls!

Nobody says anything!

No one mentions it!

Spectacular thing going on!

Hey, if I could reach,
I'd never leave the house!

Are you kidding me?

Poor little guy!
He didn't mean it!

He didn't mean it!

He'll come -
He'll apologize to you!

He'll come around a few
hours later and apologize.

He'll give you that
doggy look.

Give you them eyes,
you know.

They have such a
great expression.

Almost human!

Sometimes we say,
"Isn't he...

Look! He's almost
human, Dan!

They do.

They look like they know
something about your mother.

They're not willing to
mention it right away!

He's looking at you like
they got a trig problem

they can't quite solve.

There is a...there's a
sad look in their eyes.

All the sadness
in the world

is right in the eyes
of the dog.

Do you ever do this?

Look right into your
doggie's eyes

and think of something
really sad,

and it will look like it's
happening to your dog!

The strangest thing!

The'll look at you
like that.

You know why they have
so successful a look?

'Cause they got eyebrows!

Dogs have eyebrows,

or at least little ridges
that pass for eyebrows.

They got little things

that they can manipulate
just like we do.

Oh, please.

Please, daddy,
one more treat.

Cats can't look
at you like that!

Cats look at you coldly as
if they're testing new eyes.

The reason cats look different,
cats don't have eyebrows!

Cats have a bunch of shit
sticking out of their heads!

They thought it was
gonna be an eyebrow,

but it didn't work out!

Let's not tell them!
They think it's an eyebrow!

It's just a bunch of shit
sticking out of their heads!

Cats are all different!

They do everything
different than a doggie!

Cats are cute!
Cats are goddamn cute!

Isn't he cute?

Look at them!
God, he's cute!

He's a kitty-cat!

That's how cute they are!
They needed two names!

Kitty wasn't cute enough.

Kitty-cat!

Isn't he cute,
the kitty-cat?

Look at him!
Isn't he cute?

Let's drown him!

Ain't he a little
goddamn kitty-cat?

Ain't he, look!

Stick him on the wall.
See if he hangs up there!

Whoa!

Good goddamn kitty-cat!

They're so goddamn cute
when they're teeny.

I hope they stay
that size forever.

He's darling!

Isn't he wonderful?

Cute little goddamn
kitty-cat!

They can jump
anyway they want!

When they're teeny,

they can jump straight
up in the air

without a run!

They just go...

They can even jump
backwards to the side!

How do they do that?
Holy shit!

They can do anything!

Jump and be cute
as can be!

Cute goddamn kitty-cat!
Isn't he cute?

God I love them.
They're so cute!

They're even cute
when they kill!

Hey, look!
He's playing with a mouse!

Bullshit!

Mouse doesn't
feel that way!

They're cute.
Oh, he's so precious

just tearing the throat
right out of that bird!

Cute as can be!
They kill.

See they like to
kill somethin'.

That's what they
want to do.

That's why they
act so nice!

They wanna go...

Even when they're teeny!
When they're just born!

You take a baby-baby!

That is, a human...

You take a baby dog
and a baby cat

and you attack all
three of them

which I try never to
do if I can help it,

but you get three
different results.

You attack a baby,
he cries.

You attack a puppy,
he cowers!

You attack a kitty-cat,
he fights!

One day old, they're
looking for some shit.

They ain't even have
their eyes open!

They'll grab anything.

Nasty little cute thing.

Cute little nasty guy!

Oh, they're wonderful,
God, I love them!

They're so physical.

That's what's fun.
They're so physical!

They love to rub on you!
They love to rub on you.

If you've got a leg,
and a cat,

you've got a party!

Oh boy! Oh boy!
Oh boy!

I love his leg,
oh boy!

I'm rubbing on his leg,
oh boy!

If you've got two legs,
shit!

Jubilee celebration time!

Oh boy! Two legs!
Hot shit!

I can do the figure eight!

They love to do
the figure eight!

Oh boy, oh boy!

I love to rub on his leg!

They'll rub against your leg
even if you're not there yet!

You may still be 50
feet down the hall!

They see you coming:

Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!

Soon I'll be rubbing
on his leg!

They'll even move on sideways
so they don't miss you!

Oh, boy! Oh boy!

They love it.
They're so physical.

You don't have to pet a cat.

You just put your
hand over,

and he'll do all
the work, man.

Have you ever petted a cat
who's lying absolutely flat?

Before you're
halfway finished,

hiss ass is way up
in the air!

Like you pressed the
ass-button or something!

Isn't he a cute little...
Holy shit!

How did he do that?

Then they jump on
your chest

and put their ass
right in your face!

Here's my ass, dad!

Check this ass, huh?

And while they're
showing you their ass,

they give you
some of this stuff.

I say get him
off of me!

Jesus, I hate that!

I don't even know what it
is and I don't like it!

Looks like they're
into some bad drug!

There's one other quality
cats have which I admire.

Cats don't accept blame.

They don't
embarrass at all.

Cats do something dumb.

They don't know you've
been looking at them.

Dog knocks over a lamp,

you can tell who did it just
by looking at the dog.

Not the cat!

Cat doesn't
accept any blame.

Cat moves along to
the next activity.

What's that?
Not me.

Fuck that!
I'm a cat.

Something break?
Ask the dog.

Cat doesn't get
embarrassed.

Have you seen a cat
race across the carpet

and crash into
a glass door?

I meant that, I meant that,
I meant that.

That's exactly how
I wanted that to look!

Fucking me-ow!

Fucking me-ow!

Fucking me-ow!

That's what they say when
they get behind the couch.

A cat's too proud to
let you see him suffer.

If you look
behind the couch,

you'll find your
cat recuperating

from a domestic accident.

They got little slings
and walkers, you know.

Tried to make the
window from the lamp!

Little kitty-cat!
Goddamn kitty-cat!

Do you realize Hitler
only had one ball?

What do you think
about a man with one ball?

Do you think he has
two strikes against him?

Maybe he's got one ball
and two strikes!

Hitler only had one ball!

A lot of people
don't know that!

A lot of people don't
know that.

They say,
"Hitler, geez!

He had a lot of balls!"

One!

Sometimes I was trying to get
a list of words together

that would fairly
represent the dirty words!

'cause nobody gives you
a list of dirty words!

In life.
Have you noticed that?

There's some words that
are perfectly clean

but sound like they
could be filthy

if you gave them
just a little help.

A word like pussyfoot.

It's perfectly clean!

But when you say pussyfoot,
there's a little giggle!

'Cause people know that
with a little help

this word could be filthy!

No matter what form
of the verb you try.

It's clean as a verb.

But pussyfoot
could be a noun.

It could be a noun.
Pussyfoot.

A rare disorder!

Female birth defect!

Hello, boys.

I have pussyfoot!

God, you sure do, lady!

And I love them open-toed
shoes you have on!

Well, I'd rather have
pussyfoot than woodpecker.

I can say that...

Or beer nuts.

God, that must be awful!

Beer nuts!

The official disease
of Milwaukee!

I know whenever I see the
little canister behind the bar

I drop in a couple of
dollars for beer nuts.

I think we need a lot more
research on beer nuts

or cotton balls

which is the dreaded
final stage of beer nuts!

When my beer nuts
turn to cotton balls

I'll be heading home
to you!

It's an old Southern hymn!

There are lots of little
phrases like that

in the language that don't
quite say what they mean.

Take a shit
is another one!

Take a shit?

You don't take a shit!
You leave a shit!

That's the whole idea!

To leave it!

I left a shit!

Fine.
Thank you, Jeff!

Where did you leave it?

In the icebox!

I'm gonna take a shit!

Don't take one of mine!

I only have two left and
the weekend is coming up!

Why don't you go home and
take one of your own shits?

Guy's always
mooching off me!

He must think I'm made
of shit or something!

Well, that shit don't
grow in trees, you know!

Well, enough of that shit!

Lots of little
phrases like that!

Pick your nose or
blow your nose!

Blow your nose
is a phrase.

Imagine that.

Blowing your nose!

I don't believe they
really mean that, do you?

You can't blow your nose.

I believe it's
physically impossible

to blow your nose.

You might get somebody
else to blow your nose!

But it would have to
be a real good friend!

Cocktails...

Another clean word.

You can advertise

and you can put up
signs all over town!

Cocktails!

Long as you use both
halves of the word,

perfectly fine!

But you can't advertise either
one of those two items

if your break those
words in half.

They'll come and
take your sign down!

Cocktail!
It's OK!

It depends on how you
say that kind of word!

You ladies like
some cocktails?

Hey, lady!

You want a cocktail?

Cockpit.

Men don't like to
laugh about that!

Cockpit. Get it?
Oh, yeah.

Bangkok.

There's a lovely city!

How would you like to
be a hooker in Bangkok?

Would seem like a
natural habitat!

Peacock!

NBC is really proud
of their peacock!

Do you know what a
female peacock is?

A peacunt!

So my list,

I just was trying to
isolate the words

that are always filthy,

not the ones that were
sometimes dirty!

And the original list
was shit, piss,

fuck, cunt, cocksucker,
motherfucker and tits.

This is all I could
think of in one sitting!

Just one try!

Well, we had to add a few.

We had shit, piss,
fuck, cunt, cocksucker,

motherfucker, tits

and then we added
fart, turd and twat

which also don't have
other meanings, you know,

twat's twat,
and that's that!

But after a while,
it didn't take long.

Well, it took
quite awhile but

I finally discovered
that there were only

two words on the list
that really had to deal with,

to sort of to look at
the double standard

that television uses where
language is concerned.

The two words
were fart and fuck.

Those are the only two.

They seem similar 'cause you
can't say either one of them.

You can't say fart
and you can't say fuck.

No matter how cleverly
you try to work them in

no matter how clinical
the conversation is.

Fart and fuck will not
show up on the final take.

You simply cannot say them.

But that's where
the similarity ends

'cause at least
for the word fuck

even though you can't
say the word fuck,

you can talk
about fucking,

or you can refer
to fucking.

There's lot of fuck-talk
going on on TV!

They just don't
call it fucking!

That's the secret!
They don't use that word!

There's plenty
of fuck-talk!

Have you seen people who
wrote a book about fucking?

You've seen a guy in a talk
show wrote a book about fucking!

How to fuck, who to fuck,
when to fuck,

what to fuck, and how
to feel after you fuck!

This man is a fuck expert,

and he wrote a fuck book

and he's talking to
Merv Griffin about fucking!

And they're getting
away with it

'cause they don't
call it fucking!

Same with the soap operas,

everybody, you take a
look at the soap opera.

You know, everybody
is fucking somebody

on a soap opera!

If they're not
fucking somebody

they're trying to
fuck somebody!

Will he fuck her?
Did he fuck her?

Has he fucked her?
Should he fuck her?

Can he fuck her
some more?

Will they fuck too much?

Will they get
silly from fucking?

Who's fucking who?
That's all you wanna know!

Is what the fuck is going
on on this program here?

You know that somebody
is getting fucked

and you think it's you!

So there's lot of fuck-talk

and there's plenty of
fucking on television.

They just don't
call it fucking!

They call it
everything else!

Now, on the other hand,
farts

not only can you not
mention the word fart

but you can't refer
to farts at all!

That's how bad farts are!

They're worse than fucking!

You never hear anybody
talking about farts on TV!

Never seen a guy who
wrote a book on farts.

How to fart,
who to fart,

and how to feel
after you fart!

There's no fart experts
on Merv Griffin show!

You don't see any farts
or fart references!

It's a fart-free zone!

Wouldn't you think
after 35 years

one guy by now
would have gone...

Just once!

Just once I'd like
to see someone on

the Johnny Carson panel

say, "Hey, Ed!
Move down, man!

That was a
Clydesdale fart!"

Well, anyway.

After a while,
I realized that I was

needlessly restricting
myself to seven words

and only to the ones that
weren't allowed on TV!

I mean, there were a
lot more to be looked at,

and television isn't the
only place that objects

to your language
sometimes.

There are lots
of situations

where you're not
supposed to say that

so I expanded the list
by as many as I could,

and I'd like to share
some with you now.

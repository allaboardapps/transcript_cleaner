
0:07.4
 
0:08.5
 
 Everybody's heard
 the old joke,
 
0:08.5
 
0:10.1
 
 "How do you get to
 Carnegie Hall?"
 
0:10.2
 
0:12.1
 
 "Practice, man.
 Practice."
 
0:12.1
 
0:14.0
 
 Well, like most people
 I did all my practicing
 
0:14.0
 
0:16.4
 
 at home in my own
 neighborhood.
 
0:16.4
 
0:19.0
 
 I grew up on the Upper
 West Side in New York City.
 
0:19.0
 
0:21.0
 
 General Grant was
 one of my neighbors.
 
0:22.0
 
0:23.5
 
 I had a lot of fun
 in my neighborhood.
 
0:23.5
 
0:25.7
 
 I did a lot of practicing,
 and sooner or later,
 
0:25.8
 
0:27.5
 
I just wanted to
get downtown
 
0:27.6
 
0:29.1
 
 to show what I could do
 
0:29.1
 
0:31.5
 
 and I had to find out
 how to get there.
 
0:33.5
 
0:35.6
 
In New York City, if you don't
know how to get somewhere,
 
0:35.6
 
0:37.2
 
all you gotta do
is ask somebody:
 
0:37.2
 
0:39.7
 
They'll tell you even
if they don't know.
 
0:40.7
 
0:42.5
 
Hey, tell me somethin',
you got a second?
 
0:42.5
 
0:43.3
 
Uh-huh.
 
0:43.3
 
0:45.4
 
How do you get to
Carnegie Hall?
 
0:45.5
 
0:46.8
 
I don't know.
I really couldn't tell you.
 
0:46.8
 
0:48.7
 
Yeah, are you from
'round here?
 
0:48.7
 
0:50.3
 
Oh, yeah.
I live right there!
 
0:50.4
 
0:51.6
 
I don't even know
where I am now.
 
0:51.6
 
0:54.1
 
How am I gonna tell you
how to get to Carnegie Hall?
 
0:54.1
 
0:55.4
 
How do you get to
Carnegie Hall?
 
0:55.4
 
0:56.4
 
From here?
 
0:56.4
 
0:58.2
 
Well, no,
from the moon.
 
0:58.3
 
0:59.7
 
Take the bus upon
the corner there,
 
0:59.7
 
1:01.5
 
down to 57th street,
get off there.
 
1:01.5
 
1:03.3
 
It's a block walk.
 
1:03.3
 
1:04.7
 
Can I take the
subway here?
 
1:04.7
 
1:06.0
 
Got a gun permit?
 
1:06.1
 
1:07.4
 
Take the plane.
 
1:07.4
 
1:09.4
 
Take the plane?
 
1:09.4
 
1:11.2
 
The 59th street plane?
 
1:11.3
 
1:13.3
 
Well, that depends on
which way you wanna go.
 
1:13.3
 
1:16.8
 
Well, all I can say is you
can take a car down there.
 
1:16.8
 
1:17.7
 
Take the bus.
 
1:17.7
 
1:19.1
 
It'll leave you
right in front of there.
 
1:19.1
 
1:20.1
 
OK.
 
1:20.1
 
1:21.5
 
I don't know the number,
but I'll get there.
 
1:21.5
 
1:23.0
 
Jump on a cab.
 
1:23.0
 
1:24.4
 
You tell the man to
take you downtown.
 
1:24.4
 
1:26.6
 
If you got no bread,
just jump out.
 
1:26.6
 
1:27.6
 
How you get to
Carnegie Hall?
 
1:27.6
 
1:28.7
 
Yeah.
 
1:28.7
 
1:30.3
 
Well, if you don't have a car,
you use the subway.
 
1:30.3
 
1:32.2
 
And then if you
don't have money,
 
1:32.2
 
1:34.3
 
you hop the turnstile.
 
1:34.4
 
1:38.1
 
Then if you for real
you go to court.
 
1:39.4
 
1:40.5
 
As you can see,
 
1:40.5
 
1:42.9
 
not everybody agrees
on how to get there.
 
1:43.0
 
1:44.0
 
Now, when I was a kid,
 
1:44.0
 
1:45.6
 
if you wanted to get
somewhere,
 
1:45.7
 
1:49.3
 
you had to take whatever
ride was available.
 
1:49.3
 
1:51.9
 
I believe my ride
has just arrived.
 
2:16.3
 
2:17.8
 
Hi there!
How are you?
 
2:19.0
 
2:20.3
 
Hi-ya doing?
 
2:21.4
 
2:23.7
 
Hi-ya doing?
Good evening, everybody!
 
2:23.7
 
2:26.2
 
Hello there.
Thank you.
 
2:26.2
 
2:27.5
 
Thanks a lot.
 
2:29.4
 
2:32.3
 
Have you noticed that most
women who are against abortion
 
2:32.3
 
2:35.6
 
are women that you wouldn't
wanna fuck in the first place?
 
2:41.1
 
2:42.4
 
Thank you very much,
Ladies and gentlemen.
 
2:42.5
 
2:44.3
 
Good evening.
My name is George Carlin
 
2:44.3
 
2:46.5
 
and I am a
professional comedian
 
2:46.5
 
2:54.6
 
as opposed to the kind you run
into at work all day long.
 
2:54.7
 
2:55.7
 
It's nice,
being a comedian.
 
2:55.7
 
2:58.6
 
There are certain
advantages, naturally,
 
2:58.6
 
2:59.9
 
and a few disadvantages.
 
2:59.9
 
3:02.9
 
There are some drawbacks
to being a comedian.
 
3:02.9
 
3:05.4
 
No one on death row
has ever said,
 
3:05.4
 
3:12.3
 
"Before I die, I wanna
talk to a comedian!"
 
3:12.3
 
3:14.5
 
Have you ever heard anyone at
the scene of an accident say,
 
3:14.5
 
3:17.9
 
"Quick! Call a comedian
for God's sake!"
 
3:21.6
 
3:23.1
 
But, it would be kind of
fun at an accident
 
3:23.2
 
3:24.5
 
to push your way through
the crowd and say,
 
3:24.5
 
3:31.0
 
"May I be of help?
I am a professional comedian!"
 
3:31.1
 
3:34.6
 
And sooner or later at
least once in your life
 
3:34.6
 
3:37.5
 
when the policeman
says to you,
 
3:37.5
 
3:40.0
 
"What are you,
a comedian?"
 
3:51.5
 
3:54.9
 
You've got to look him
right in the eye and say,
 
3:55.0
 
3:58.9
 
"Actually, yes!"
 
3:58.9
 
4:02.2
 
Even the criminals have
no respect for comedians.
 
4:02.2
 
4:04.4
 
What do they say first thing
they do when they hold you up?
 
4:04.4
 
4:08.8
 
"Don't try anything funny!
 
4:08.8
 
4:11.7
 
The first one makes a
funny move, gets it!"
 
4:11.8
 
4:13.8
 
Whenever they're not
looking, I go...
 
4:22.9
 
4:26.8
 
Well, that's my job!
Thinking of goofy shit!
 
4:26.8
 
4:29.0
 
Thinking of goofy shit, coming
around every now and then,
 
4:29.0
 
4:31.1
 
letting you know what it is
 
4:31.2
 
4:34.4
 
or reminding you of
things you already know
 
4:34.4
 
4:39.1
 
but forgot to laugh at the
first time they happened.
 
4:39.2
 
4:40.1
 
We all have
things like that!
 
4:40.2
 
4:42.1
 
You hear them, then you
don't remember at all!
 
4:42.1
 
4:44.4
 
For instance, I've noticed
they have disposable douches
 
4:44.5
 
4:45.4
 
and I'm wondering
 
4:45.4
 
4:48.0
 
who would wanna keep it
in the first place?
 
4:57.0
 
5:00.4
 
I do have a lot...not a lot but
I have some notes over here
 
5:00.4
 
5:03.2
 
and the reason for that is I
haven't been doing this lately.
 
5:03.2
 
5:05.8
 
I wanna make sure I know and
remember everything tonight.
 
5:05.8
 
5:07.1
 
I've been taking
little time off.
 
5:07.1
 
5:08.5
 
About six months,
I think,
 
5:08.5
 
5:12.7
 
I took three of them
quite voluntarily,
 
5:12.7
 
5:16.1
 
and the other three
quite against my will.
 
5:16.1
 
5:17.4
 
I had a heart attack,
 
5:17.5
 
5:21.2
 
or as they say in Boston,
"I had a heart attack."
 
5:21.2
 
5:23.0
 
"He had a heart attack.
Do you hear that, George?
 
5:23.0
 
5:28.1
 
He had a goddamn
myocardial infarction."
 
5:28.2
 
5:30.4
 
"I had a heart attack.
 
5:30.4
 
5:31.8
 
Fortunately,
my pharmacist,
 
5:31.9
 
5:34.2
 
my cardiologist
and my doctor
 
5:34.2
 
5:38.4
 
gave me CPR."
 
5:38.5
 
5:39.8
 
But I would like to
bring you up to date
 
5:39.8
 
5:43.9
 
on the comedian's
health sweepstakes.
 
5:44.0
 
5:45.9
 
As it stands right now,
 
5:45.9
 
5:48.4
 
I lead Richard Pryor
in heart attacks
 
5:48.5
 
5:51.5
 
two to one.
 
5:51.5
 
5:53.2
 
I am ahead.
That's right.
 
5:53.2
 
5:58.0
 
Now, however, Richard still
leads me one to nothing
 
5:58.0
 
6:04.5
 
on burning yourself up.
 
6:04.5
 
6:07.7
 
Well, what happened was, first,
Richard had a heart attack
 
6:07.7
 
6:09.6
 
then I had a heart attack,
 
6:09.6
 
6:11.7
 
then Richard burned
himself up.
 
6:11.8
 
6:12.9
 
Then I said fuck that.
 
6:13.0
 
6:15.0
 
I'm going to have
another heart attack.
 
6:21.1
 
6:25.7
 
I had an interesting morning,
got into an argument...
 
6:25.8
 
6:30.2
 
Got into an argument
with my Rice Krispies.
 
6:30.2
 
6:33.9
 
I distinctly heard,
"Snap, crackle, fuck him!"
 
6:39.7
 
6:43.5
 
I don't know which
one of them said it.
 
6:43.6
 
6:45.5
 
I was reaching for the
artificial sweetener
 
6:45.5
 
6:49.4
 
and was not looking
directly into the bowl,
 
6:49.5
 
6:50.5
 
but I told them,
I said,
 
6:50.6
 
6:54.5
 
"Well, you can all just sit
right there in the milk!
 
6:54.5
 
6:59.2
 
As far as I'm concerned,
you can sit in the milk
 
6:59.2
 
7:03.9
 
until I find out which
one of you said that!"
 
7:03.9
 
7:07.3
 
A little mass punishment
for my breakfast food.
 
7:07.3
 
7:11.2
 
The idea is to turn them
against one another,
 
7:11.3
 
7:17.1
 
"Just sit in the milk as
far as I'm concerned!"
 
7:17.1
 
7:18.4
 
Silly me.
 
7:18.4
 
7:21.6
 
Big punishment.
That's what they do anyway.
 
7:21.6
 
7:23.2
 
Sit in the milk.
 
7:23.3
 
7:25.3
 
That's their job.
 
7:25.3
 
7:30.2
 
That's Rice Krispies' job.
Sitting in the milk.
 
7:30.3
 
7:33.1
 
You've seen them,
haven't you?
 
7:33.1
 
7:35.7
 
Floating along,
 
7:35.7
 
7:40.3
 
little beige blisters of air,
 
7:40.3
 
7:44.3
 
riding proudly in the milk,
 
7:44.3
 
7:47.6
 
but you can't sink them.
They float for a long time.
 
7:47.6
 
7:49.6
 
Do you know why?
They stay together.
 
7:49.6
 
7:52.3
 
They gather together
in little groups.
 
7:52.3
 
7:55.7
 
Little groups of 8, 10, 12,
sometimes 14,
 
7:55.7
 
7:59.2
 
but always an even
number if you've noticed.
 
7:59.2
 
8:02.9
 
It's the polarity of the
Krispies that attracts them.
 
8:03.0
 
8:05.9
 
They form little colonies
of Rice Krispies.
 
8:11.5
 
8:12.3
 
But you can't sink them!
 
8:12.3
 
8:14.2
 
You try to sink
them with a spoon,
 
8:14.2
 
8:16.1
 
they come up
over the sides.
 
8:17.4
 
8:21.2
 
You can't sink them.
That's what the fruit is for.
 
8:21.3
 
8:24.2
 
Sinking the Rice Krispies.
 
8:24.3
 
8:27.8
 
A good-sized peach will
take down 80 or 90 of them.
 
8:32.6
 
8:33.5
 
If I'm really pissed,
 
8:33.5
 
8:35.9
 
I'll drop a
watermelon on them.
 
8:40.7
 
8:43.4
 
But I say interesting about my
morning 'cause it was...
 
8:43.4
 
8:46.9
 
I don't have
a nice day anymore.
 
8:46.9
 
8:48.8
 
I don't bother
much with that.
 
8:48.9
 
8:50.1
 
I think I'm beyond that now.
 
8:50.1
 
8:52.5
 
I think I've outgrown
the nice day.
 
8:52.6
 
8:54.7
 
I think I've had my share.
 
8:54.7
 
8:57.8
 
Why should I be hugging
all the really nice ones?
 
8:57.9
 
9:00.8
 
Let somebody else
have a few.
 
9:00.9
 
9:05.7
 
Of course, everybody
still wants me to have one.
 
9:05.8
 
9:10.4
 
Everybody wants me
to have a nice day.
 
9:10.4
 
9:13.8
 
Have a nice day!
 
9:13.9
 
9:16.3
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 
9:16.3
 
9:22.0
 
Wanna give me my
fucking change, please?
 
9:22.0
 
9:24.0
 
I'm triple parked!
 
9:27.5
 
9:28.8
 
Some of them are
really insistent.
 
9:28.8
 
9:30.9
 
"I SAID HAVE A NICE DAY!"
 
9:30.9
 
9:34.7
 
Alright. Alright goddamnit.
I'll give it a shot!
 
9:34.8
 
9:36.4
 
That's the trouble with
"Have a nice day!"
 
9:36.4
 
9:39.9
 
It puts all the
pressure on you.
 
9:39.9
 
9:42.3
 
Now you've gotta go out
and somehow manage
 
9:42.3
 
9:44.4
 
to have a good time!
 
9:44.4
 
9:48.6
 
All because of some
loose-lip cashier.
 
9:48.6
 
9:50.1
 
Have a nice day.
 
9:50.1
 
9:53.8
 
Maybe I don't feel like
having a nice day.
 
9:53.9
 
9:55.1
 
Maybe, just maybe,
 
9:55.1
 
9:59.0
 
I've had 116
nice days in a row!
 
9:59.0
 
10:02.7
 
And I'm ready, by God,
for a crappy day!
 
10:02.8
 
10:04.5
 
I never hear that!
Let them wish one of them!
 
10:04.5
 
10:07.1
 
Hey, have a crappy day!
 
10:07.1
 
10:11.4
 
Thank you, and to your
wonderful family as well!
 
10:11.4
 
10:12.8
 
A crappy day!
Hey, that'll be easy!
 
10:12.8
 
10:15.0
 
It's no trouble at all!
A crappy day,
 
10:15.0
 
10:18.3
 
just get up!
 
10:18.3
 
10:21.3
 
There's no planning
involved for a crappy day!
 
10:24.2
 
10:26.0
 
I know what it is that bothers
me about that whole thing.
 
10:26.1
 
10:28.3
 
It's the word nice.
 
10:28.3
 
10:31.0
 
It's just a weak word.
 
10:31.0
 
10:32.3
 
Doesn't have a lot of
character, you know?
 
10:32.3
 
10:33.7
 
Nice!
 
10:33.8
 
10:36.5
 
Isn't he nice?
 
10:36.6
 
10:39.6
 
Oh, he's so nice,
 
10:39.6
 
10:43.9
 
and she is nice, too!
 
10:43.9
 
10:46.2
 
Isn't that nice?
 
10:46.3
 
10:49.9
 
How nice they are!
 
10:50.0
 
10:52.5
 
I never cared for that,
you know?
 
10:52.5
 
10:54.0
 
It's like fine.
 
10:54.0
 
10:55.1
 
There's another word!
How are you?
 
10:55.1
 
10:57.7
 
Fine!
 
10:57.8
 
10:59.9
 
Bullshit!
 
11:06.3
 
11:09.2
 
Nobody's fine!
 
11:09.2
 
11:12.1
 
Hair is fine.
 
11:12.2
 
11:15.7
 
How's your hair?
Fine!
 
11:15.7
 
11:17.9
 
That makes a lot
more sense to me!
 
11:20.5
 
11:23.5
 
Some guys are great!
 
11:23.5
 
11:25.7
 
Ever meet those guys?
Great!
 
11:25.8
 
11:26.7
 
Isn't this great?
 
11:26.7
 
11:29.4
 
Goddamn, this is great!
 
11:29.4
 
11:30.7
 
Look, they're
gonna kill that guy!
 
11:30.7
 
11:32.4
 
Isn't that great?
 
11:32.4
 
11:34.3
 
That's great!
 
11:37.2
 
11:38.9
 
No, not me,
I'm not nice.
 
11:39.0
 
11:40.0
 
I'm not fine.
 
11:40.0
 
11:41.2
 
I'm not great.
 
11:41.2
 
11:46.1
 
People ask me how I am.
I say I'm fairly decent.
 
11:46.2
 
11:47.4
 
I don't get too
many superlatives,
 
11:47.5
 
11:48.6
 
nothing to gossip about.
 
11:48.7
 
11:50.7
 
Relatively OK!
 
11:50.7
 
11:56.0
 
Sometimes I'll say,
"I'm moderately neeto!"
 
11:56.0
 
11:57.5
 
If I'm in a particularly
jaunty mood,
 
11:57.5
 
12:00.7
 
I'll say, "I'm not unwell.
Thank you."
 
12:00.8
 
12:01.9
 
That pisses them off,
 
12:01.9
 
12:04.6
 
'cause they have to figure
that one out for themselves.
 
12:08.0
 
12:09.3
 
So...
 
12:12.4
 
12:13.9
 
It reminds me of something
my first grade teacher
 
12:13.9
 
12:16.2
 
used to say to me.
 
12:16.3
 
12:17.5
 
A little lady.
 
12:17.5
 
12:19.3
 
She used to say,
 
12:19.3
 
12:20.5
 
"You show me a
tropical fruit,
 
12:20.5
 
12:23.7
 
and I'll show you a
cocksucker from Guatemala."
 
12:31.4
 
12:35.3
 
No, that was someone else.
That was someone else.
 
12:35.4
 
12:38.3
 
I think it was someone
I met in the army.
 
12:38.3
 
12:41.9
 
I always confuse them.
I don't know what it is.
 
12:41.9
 
12:43.2
 
Have you ever been looking
through the refrigerator
 
12:43.2
 
12:45.7
 
and come across
an empty plate?
 
12:48.9
 
12:53.3
 
Well, that starts
me to wondering.
 
12:53.4
 
12:57.2
 
Did something eat
something else?
 
13:07.2
 
13:10.9
 
Maybe the olives
ate the peas!
 
13:10.9
 
13:15.5
 
Maybe the chicken
isn't really dead!
 
13:15.6
 
13:19.2
 
And he's grazing
on my stuff!
 
13:19.2
 
13:20.7
 
Actually, I picture
a little mouse
 
13:20.7
 
13:23.4
 
with gloves and a
parka on, you know?
 
13:26.2
 
13:27.6
 
Just waiting for the
lights to go out
 
13:27.6
 
13:29.4
 
so it can get back to work.
 
13:32.1
 
13:33.9
 
I guess the worst thing that
can happen cleaning out
 
13:34.0
 
13:36.2
 
or looking through
the refrigerator
 
13:36.3
 
13:41.2
 
is to come across something
 
13:41.3
 
13:47.6
 
that you cannot
identify at all!
 
13:47.6
 
13:52.1
 
You literally do not
know what it is!
 
13:52.1
 
13:55.2
 
It could be meat.
 
13:55.2
 
14:00.6
 
It could be cake!
 
14:00.6
 
14:02.4
 
Usually,
at a time like that,
 
14:02.4
 
14:04.6
 
I'll bluff.
 
14:04.6
 
14:06.5
 
Honey?
 
14:06.5
 
14:10.2
 
Is this good?
 
14:10.2
 
14:12.9
 
Well, what is it?
 
14:12.9
 
14:15.3
 
I don't know!
 
14:15.3
 
14:19.6
 
I've never seen
anything like it!
 
14:19.6
 
14:26.5
 
It looks like meat-cake!
 
14:26.5
 
14:29.0
 
Well, smell it!
 
14:38.0
 
14:41.7
 
Actually, it has no
smell whatsoever!
 
14:41.7
 
14:45.6
 
It's good!
 
14:45.6
 
14:49.5
 
Put it back!
 
14:49.5
 
14:53.6
 
Somebody is saving it!
 
14:53.6
 
14:56.7
 
It'll turn up in something!
 
14:56.7
 
15:00.3
 
That what's frightens me!
 
15:00.3
 
15:02.9
 
I was what they called
a "fussy eater".
 
15:02.9
 
15:04.7
 
He is fussy.
 
15:04.7
 
15:07.5
 
He is a fussy eater.
 
15:07.6
 
15:14.0
 
Fussy eater is an euphemism
for big pain in the ass!
 
15:14.1
 
15:16.5
 
I mean, if I didn't like
something I told them.
 
15:16.5
 
15:18.5
 
I didn't play with my food.
 
15:18.5
 
15:22.0
 
Picked up my food and said,
"I don't like that!"
 
15:22.0
 
15:23.8
 
You make this?
 
15:23.9
 
15:26.4
 
I don't like it!
 
15:26.4
 
15:28.1
 
Why?
 
15:28.1
 
15:31.1
 
They wanted reasons.
 
15:31.2
 
15:33.9
 
Well, you don't always
have a reason!
 
15:33.9
 
15:35.8
 
I don't know!
 
15:35.9
 
15:38.4
 
I know I don't like it!
 
15:38.4
 
15:43.5
 
And I know that if I ate it,
I would like it even less!
 
15:43.5
 
15:46.3
 
You like it,
you eat it!
 
15:54.1
 
15:58.1
 
Then, they would try to
corner me with logic.
 
15:58.1
 
16:04.3
 
How do you know
you don't like it
 
16:04.3
 
16:09.3
 
if you've never even tried?
 
16:09.3
 
16:15.2
 
It came to me in a dream!
 
16:15.2
 
16:19.2
 
Big pain in the ass!
 
16:19.2
 
16:22.4
 
Some things I didn't like just
because the sound of the food!
 
16:22.5
 
16:25.7
 
And to this day,
I can still not eat
 
16:25.7
 
16:27.9
 
"yoghurt!"
 
16:27.9
 
16:30.1
 
Yog- Yoghurt!
 
16:30.1
 
16:33.4
 
It sounds like
it's coming up again!
 
16:33.5
 
16:37.1
 
Yog- Yoghurt!
 
16:37.1
 
16:40.8
 
I can't eat anything with
a "Y" and a "G" in it.
 
16:44.6
 
16:46.3
 
Something else that
doesn't sound so good.
 
16:46.3
 
16:48.5
 
Squash!
 
16:48.5
 
16:51.0
 
You want some squash?
 
16:51.0
 
16:54.3
 
Shit, no!
 
16:54.3
 
16:57.1
 
Sounds like somebody
sat on my dinner!
 
17:02.4
 
17:04.8
 
Succotash!
 
17:04.8
 
17:05.7
 
You want some succotash?
 
17:05.7
 
17:06.7
 
What did you call me?
You fuck!
 
17:06.7
 
17:08.5
 
Look out!
Heh!"
 
17:08.5
 
17:11.3
 
Come on...hey, hey,
fucking cool out!
 
17:11.4
 
17:12.8
 
Hey, it's fucking
beans and corn!
 
17:12.8
 
17:14.9
 
Cool out!
Cool out!"
 
17:18.3
 
17:21.2
 
Wheat germ.
 
17:21.2
 
17:26.3
 
No, get it off my plate!
 
17:26.3
 
17:29.4
 
Even something like
eggplant!
 
17:29.4
 
17:32.2
 
Well, which one is it,
anyway?
 
17:32.2
 
17:35.4
 
Tell it to make up its mind
and then come on back!
 
17:38.5
 
17:41.9
 
Terrible sounding food.
 
17:41.9
 
17:44.1
 
Head cheese.
 
17:44.2
 
17:49.0
 
Uh! Uh! Uh!
 
17:54.9
 
17:59.2
 
I can't even look
at the sign!
 
17:59.2
 
18:00.5
 
I'll be down near
the bolognese!
 
18:00.5
 
18:02.1
 
You look at it!"
 
18:05.5
 
18:07.0
 
Between head cheese
and blood tongue,
 
18:07.1
 
18:10.0
 
I may never eat again!
 
18:10.1
 
18:12.7
 
Certainly, it won't be
at the Deli!
 
18:12.7
 
18:16.4
 
Then there are some foods
that sound too humorous to eat.
 
18:16.4
 
18:18.9
 
Did you hear something
too funny to eat?
 
18:18.9
 
18:21.9
 
Guacamole.
 
18:21.9
 
18:24.5
 
Sounds like something
you wear to a dance!
 
18:24.6
 
18:27.1
 
May I borrow your
green Guacamole?
 
18:32.8
 
18:35.4
 
Garbanzo.
 
18:35.4
 
18:38.3
 
Hey, want some
garbanzo's?
 
18:38.3
 
18:39.4
 
That sounds like
a circus act!
 
18:39.5
 
18:41.6
 
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Garbanzo's!
 
18:47.8
 
18:50.0
 
And the funniest
food of all time,
 
18:50.0
 
18:54.5
 
kumquats.
 
18:54.5
 
18:57.5
 
I don't bring them
home anymore!
 
18:57.5
 
19:00.0
 
Just go to waste.
 
19:00.0
 
19:01.9
 
Some things
don't look right.
 
19:01.9
 
19:04.0
 
I don't like that, Ma!
 
19:04.1
 
19:06.7
 
Don't look right to me!
 
19:06.7
 
19:09.1
 
Did you make that?
 
19:09.1
 
19:13.3
 
Is there a picture of
it in the cookbook?
 
19:13.4
 
19:16.0
 
I bet it don't
look like that!
 
19:20.7
 
19:21.5
 
Let's face it!
Be honest!
 
19:21.6
 
19:24.4
 
Some things
don't look right!
 
19:24.4
 
19:25.8
 
Of course, some people
will eat anything.
 
19:25.9
 
19:27.2
 
I know that!
Some guys eat anything!
 
19:27.3
 
19:29.0
 
I saw those guys in the
army on the chow line!
 
19:29.1
 
19:29.9
 
What's this?
Never mind!
 
19:29.9
 
19:32.0
 
Gimme a whole lot of it!
 
19:32.0
 
19:34.8
 
That's rat's asshole, Don!
 
19:39.1
 
19:41.4
 
Well, it certainly makes
a hell of a fondue!
 
19:44.1
 
19:47.5
 
I don't eat anything
I don't recognize immediately!
 
19:47.6
 
19:48.8
 
If I have to ask
questions, fuck it!
 
19:48.9
 
19:51.7
 
I pass, you know?
 
19:51.7
 
19:53.1
 
Tomatoes don't
look right, either.
 
19:53.1
 
19:54.6
 
On the outside,
they're fine...
 
19:54.6
 
19:56.1
 
Tomatoes look lovely
on the outside!
 
19:56.1
 
19:59.4
 
But you look inside a tomato
and something is wrong.
 
19:59.5
 
20:02.5
 
Something is gone afoul
inside of a tomato!
 
20:02.5
 
20:03.6
 
It doesn't look right,
you know?
 
20:03.7
 
20:06.2
 
It doesn't look like it's
finished yet, for one thing.
 
20:06.2
 
20:10.3
 
It looks like it's in the
larval stage or something!
 
20:10.3
 
20:11.4
 
It's thousands of seeds
 
20:11.4
 
20:13.8
 
and a whole bunch of
jelly-looking stuff!
 
20:18.4
 
20:20.9
 
Get it off my plate!
 
20:21.0
 
20:21.9
 
It's gushy!
 
20:21.9
 
20:23.9
 
It's like the stuff
at the end of an egg.
 
20:26.8
 
20:28.6
 
And I know it's not
the end of an egg.
 
20:28.7
 
20:32.4
 
It's the beginning
of a chicken!
 
20:32.5
 
20:34.2
 
It's hen cum!
 
20:37.9
 
20:39.7
 
Get it off my plate!
 
20:43.3
 
20:45.0
 
It don't look right.
 
20:47.2
 
20:49.7
 
Something else that
doesn't look like food.
 
20:49.7
 
20:52.8
 
Lobsters and crabs!
 
20:52.8
 
20:59.4
 
I mean, anything coming
at me walking sideways
 
20:59.4
 
21:01.7
 
with big pinchers
 
21:01.7
 
21:04.7
 
somehow doesn't
make me hungry!
 
21:04.7
 
21:08.5
 
In fact, my instinct is,
"Step on that fuck!"
 
21:08.5
 
21:09.5
 
Look at the big bug!
 
21:09.5
 
21:11.4
 
Step on the big bug
 
21:11.5
 
21:17.1
 
before it gets to
the children!
 
21:17.2
 
21:21.1
 
They looked like he
meant business.
 
21:21.1
 
21:23.8
 
Can't order frog legs
in a restaurant.
 
21:23.9
 
21:27.4
 
I keep wondering what do they
do with the rest of the frog!
 
21:27.4
 
21:28.2
 
What do they do?
 
21:28.2
 
21:29.2
 
They give them
little dollies
 
21:29.2
 
21:30.9
 
and send them back out
into the world to beg?
 
21:37.3
 
21:38.5
 
Try!
 
21:38.6
 
21:43.5
 
Try to return them to a
normal life if you can!
 
21:43.5
 
21:45.6
 
Trouble is the
"dollies for froggies"
 
21:45.6
 
21:49.5
 
program has been
cut in half.
 
21:49.6
 
21:51.2
 
You've probably seen the
last "froggy-dolly"
 
21:51.3
 
21:55.3
 
for a long, long time...
 
21:55.3
 
21:57.5
 
I'd rather eat a
box of cookies.
 
21:57.5
 
21:58.7
 
Doesn't that always
come in handy?
 
21:58.7
 
21:59.9
 
Just eat a goddamn
box of cookies!
 
22:00.0
 
22:00.8
 
Do you ever do that?
 
22:00.8
 
22:01.8
 
A whole box of cookies,
right in a row!
 
22:01.9
 
22:02.7
 
I don't mean you
take them out.
 
22:02.8
 
22:03.8
 
I mean eat them
in the kitchen!
 
22:03.8
 
22:04.6
 
Standing right in
the kitchen,
 
22:04.6
 
22:06.2
 
eat a whole goddamn
box of cookies!
 
22:06.2
 
22:09.3
 
Just stare at the electric
clock while you're eating them!
 
22:15.0
 
22:16.5
 
Did you ever notice,
right on the cookies it says,
 
22:16.6

27:06.2
 
A lot of folks
don't know that!
 
27:06.2
 
27:09.3
 
The first guy
wrote tara-tara-tara,
 
27:09.4
 
27:13.4
 
and the second guy wrote
tararara-tara.
 
27:13.5
 
27:14.9
 
If it weren't for
that second guy,
 
27:14.9
 
27:16.3
 
the Mexican Hat Dance
would have gone
 
27:16.4
 
27:18.8
 
tara-tara-tara,
tara-tara-tara,
 
27:19.6
 
27:21.4

27:45.3
 
27:47.5
 
You know what bothers me?
 
27:47.5
 
27:49.7

27:53.1
 
27:55.6
 
Everybody knows
"ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay..."
 
28:00.6
 
28:01.6

28:01.6

ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay,
 
28:04.2
 
28:05.9
 
did you get yours today?
 
28:06.0
 
28:07.6
 
I got mine yesterday.
 
28:07.6
 
28:09.7
 
That's why I walk this way!
 
28:21.6
 
28:25.0
 
Now, how can you
tell when a moth farts?

28:30.5

28:39.2
 
28:42.1

28:48.3
 
Has to be!
 
28:48.3
 
28:49.4
 
Process of elimination,

28:52.6
 
sooner or later you're gonna
find the worst doctor!
 
28:52.6
 
28:53.5
 
And the weird part is
 
28:53.6

an appointment
 
28:55.4
 
28:57.9
 
to see him tomorrow!
 
29:01.5
 
29:03.2
 
I know, you're just
trying to butter me up.
 
29:03.2
 
29:04.9
 
Don't give me that shit!
 
29:08.1
 
29:12.0
 
Yes,
in goddamn deed!
 
29:12.1
 
29:14.5
 
I love that dog!
 
29:14.5
 
29:17.3
 
I've never seen him
and I love him.
 
29:17.3
 
29:20.7
 
It's gonna be wonderful
when I meet that dog!

29:37.8
 
Lots of people got
lots of goddamn doggies!
 
29:37.9
 
29:39.8
 
You don't even have to have
one to learn about doggies.
 
29:39.8
 
29:41.7
 
Your friend may
have a dog!
 
29:41.7
 
29:43.1
 
It could be your
friend's dog!
 
29:43.1
 
29:46.0
 
That makes him
your dog-friend!
 
29:46.1
 
29:47.6
 
You go to visit your friend!
His dog is there
 
29:47.6
 
29:48.3
 
and you'd pet him too!
 
29:48.4
 
29:49.5
 
Hi! Hello?
How are you, Sneezy?
 
29:49.6
 
29:50.7
 
You're wonderful!
Hello!
 
29:50.7
 
29:53.5
 
Goddamn, for that
moment he's your dog!
 
29:53.6
 
29:55.4
 
So you can have someone
else's dog for a while!
 
29:55.4
 
29:56.9
 
"Hi.
He likes me I think.
 
29:57.0
 
29:59.1

this doggie here!
 
29:59.2
 
30:00.1
 
Goddamn doggies!
 
30:00.1
 
30:01.3
 
Lots of things to know
about them, too.
 
30:01.3
 
30:02.4
 
Lots of things you learn.
 
30:02.4
 
30:04.3
 
You don't know where always
and you can't remember!
 
30:04.4
 
30:06.5
 
For instance, can you remember
the first time you found out
 
30:06.5
 
30:08.3
 
that by scratching
a dog here,
 
30:08.3
 
30:12.4
 
you can make this
leg go like that?
 
30:12.4
 
30:17.5
 
And that you can make
it stop when you stop!
 
30:17.5
 
30:19.2
 
Goddamn!
 
30:19.2
 
30:22.9
 
I'm in complete
control of this dog!
 
30:26.1
 
30:29.7
 
Or that you can make their head
tilt from across the room
 
30:29.7
 
30:32.2
 
just by making a
funny noise?
 
30:32.2
 
30:34.9
 
You go (sound).
 
30:35.0
 
30:36.4
 
And he goes...
 
30:40.1
 
30:42.5
 
Oh look, honey!
Isn't he cute?
 
30:42.5
 
30:48.3
 
Let's get his head fixed
so he stays like that!
 
30:48.3
 
30:50.6
 
Oh, you get the
heads done!
 
30:50.7
 
30:55.2
 
It'll cost you a bundle
and they don't like it!
 
30:55.2
 
30:58.8
 
Makes them move to the
same side all the time!
 
30:58.8
 
31:00.3
 
Cute little goddamn doggie!
 
31:00.4
 
31:03.1
 
Do you ever eat candy
right in front of your dog?
 
31:03.1
 
31:04.0
 
I don't mean a Milky Way.
 
31:04.0
 
31:07.1
 
I mean one-at-a-time candy,
like M&M's,
 
31:07.1
 
31:08.3
 
and you watch
where he's looking!
 
31:08.4
 
31:12.9
 
He's following
your fingertips!
 
31:12.9
 
31:15.0
 
Oh, boy!
 
31:15.0
 
31:18.9
 
This asshole drops
one Jujubee,
 
31:18.9
 
31:22.2
 
I'm going for his
femoral artery!
 
31:29.7
 
31:32.5
 
Do you ever spell in
front of your dog?
 
31:32.6
 
31:34.7
 
Some of them are smart.
 
31:34.7

31:39.8
 
Honey, do we anymore

31:41.4
 
They know the
sound of B alone.
 
31:41.4
 
31:45.1
 
B - bone.
Bone, bone bone...
 
31:45.1
 
31:49.6
 
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
 
31:49.6
 
31:50.8
 
There are all kinds of dogs.
 
31:50.8

31:53.6
 
There's a lot of
goddamn big dogs.
 
31:53.6
 
31:55.6
 
You know, big dogs?
I don't mean big.
 
31:55.7
 
31:59.6
 
I don't mean a big dog.
I mean a fuckin' big dog.
 
31:59.6
 
32:02.5
 
Some people has got
goddamn big doggies.
 
32:02.6

That's my dog.
 
32:13.9
 
32:16.4
 
He blacked out the sun!
 
32:19.9
 
32:21.3
 
That's tiny.
 
32:23.2
 
32:24.2
 
Little dogs are different!
 
32:24.2
 
32:25.7
 
Little dogs will get
around and do fine.
 
32:25.7
 
32:26.6
 
He'll jump all he wants.
 
32:26.6
 
32:27.6
 
I don't know how
they jump so high?
 
32:27.7
 
32:29.9
 
They got little
teeny legs like this.
 
32:29.9
 
32:30.6
 
They got legs.
 
32:30.7
 
32:31.7
 
If you feel a
little dog's leg
 
32:31.7
 
32:35.0
 
it feels like a
beef jerky in there!
 
32:35.1
 
32:36.8
 
They can jump up on the
bed all they want to.
 
32:38.6
 
32:40.7
 
Holy God!
Do that again!
 
32:40.8
 
32:42.5
 
Oh, man!
One more time!
 
32:42.5
 
32:44.6
 
I make him keep doin' it
until he can't reach anymore!
 
32:48.1
 
32:51.1
 
Then, if I want him up there,
I'll put him up there!
 
32:54.4
 
32:55.6
 
And sooner or later,
what's gonna happen
 
32:55.6
 
32:57.3
 
with the little dog?
 
32:57.3
 
32:58.6
 
Sooner or later,
lying on the bed,
 
32:58.6
 
33:01.7
 
he's gonna create
an incident.
 
33:01.8
 
33:03.5
 
He's gonna make one
of you humans turn
 
33:03.5
 
33:04.7
 
to the other and say...
 
33:10.5
 
33:15.4
 
Honey, did you fart?
 
33:15.4
 
33:17.5
 
Not me!
 
33:17.5
 
33:20.8
 
I thought you farted!
 
33:20.8
 
33:22.5
 
Not me!
 
33:24.6
 
33:29.4
 
That's not even
one of my farts!
 
33:29.4
 
33:34.8
 
I've got four farts,
and that's not one of mine!
 
33:34.8
 
33:37.6
 
I've got my Heineken's fart.
 
33:37.6
 
33:39.8
 
I've got my broccoli fart.
 
33:39.9
 
33:42.0
 
My rice pudding fart
 
33:42.0
 
33:45.0
 
and my nondairy
creamer fart!
 
33:45.0
 
33:47.5
 
And that's not
one of my farts!
 
33:50.6
 
33:53.0
 
I know.
 
33:53.1
 
33:56.1
 
The dog farted!
 
33:56.1
 
33:59.4
 
Tippy, why did you fart?
 
33:59.4
 
34:02.0
 
Look at him!
He knows he farted!
 
34:06.0
 
34:08.7
 
I've seen his
asshole open up!
 
34:14.7
 
34:17.3
 
I've seen it!
 
34:17.3
 
34:21.9
 
Well, I happened to be looking
at his asshole by chance!
 
34:22.0
 
34:25.8
 
What kind of a
question is that?
 
34:25.8
 
34:32.3
 
I thought he was doing them
deep breathing exercises.
 
34:32.3
 
34:35.6
 
You see, dogs
have nothing to do?
 
34:35.6
 
34:38.6
 
There's no job
description for a dog!
 
34:38.7
 
34:41.3
 
They're forced to wait
for something to happen
 
34:41.3
 
34:43.7
 
that they can get it on!
 
34:43.7
 
34:48.3
 
If you do something,
they'll be glad to join you!
 
34:48.3
 
34:52.0
 
They rarely initiate any
activity on their own!
 
34:52.0
 
34:54.4
 
They're just waiting,
waiting.
 
34:54.4
 
34:57.2
 
Waiting and waiting
and waiting.
 
34:57.2
 
34:58.9
 
Waiting to come in,
waiting to go out,
 
34:58.9
 
34:59.8
 
waiting to eat,
waiting to crap,
 
34:59.8
 
35:00.8
 
waiting to wake up,
waiting to sleep,
 
35:00.9
 
35:02.9
 
waiting to go upstairs,
waiting to go downstairs.
 
35:02.9
 
35:06.5
 
Sometimes they're
just waiting to wait!
 
35:06.5
 
35:08.9
 
Have you ever seen a
dog just standing there?
 
35:13.5
 
35:15.7
 
He don't know what
he's waiting for,
 
35:15.7
 
35:19.1
 
but if it happens,
he'll be ready!
 
35:19.1
 
35:22.1
 
Just waiting and waiting.
 
35:22.1
 
35:24.6
 
Waiting for you
to come home.
 
35:24.6
 
35:26.2
 
They don't understand time.
 
35:26.3
 
35:27.3
 
Dog doesn't know the
difference between
 
35:27.3
 
35:29.2
 
an hour and a half
or next week.
 
35:29.3
 
35:31.7
 
He thinks you're
gonna be gone forever!
 
35:31.7
 
35:33.9
 
That's the only time period
dogs really understand,
 
35:34.0
 
35:35.3
 
forever.
 
35:35.4
 
35:37.6
 
That's how long they
think everything lasts!
 
35:37.7
 
35:39.7
 
That's how long they
think everything takes!
 
35:39.7
 
35:41.8
 
Forever and ever!
 
35:41.8
 
35:43.2
 
You scratch your dog
behind the ears!
 
35:43.2
 
35:44.1
 
Oh, boy!
They love that!
 
35:44.1
 
35:45.0
 
Oh, boy, you're
scratching your doggy
 
35:45.1
 
35:46.2
 
behind the ears and
he really loves that
 
35:46.2
 
35:47.3
 
and you look at him
and everything,
 
35:47.4
 
35:48.3
 
and he really loves it,
and when you finally stop
 
35:48.3
 
35:51.8
 
he looks at you like
you're a criminal!
 
35:51.9
 
35:56.3
 
He thought it was gonna
go on and on and on.
 
35:56.4
 
35:57.3
 
Same thing when
you feed them.
 
35:57.4
 
35:58.3
 
Soon as they get
finished, they say,
 
35:58.3
 
36:02.2
 
"Where the fuck's
the food?"
 
36:02.2
 
36:03.6
 
They thought it was the
loaves and the fishes!
 
36:03.7
 
36:07.4
 
They were gonna
last forever and ever!
 
36:07.4
 
36:08.8
 
A dog don't know.
 
36:08.8
 
36:10.4
 
They must think we're
gonna be gone forever.
 
36:10.4
 
36:11.9
 
Otherwise, why do they
act they way they do
 
36:11.9
 
36:13.0
 
when we finally get home?
 
36:13.1
 
36:14.2
 
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!
 
36:14.2
 
36:15.0
 
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!
 
36:15.0
 
36:17.2
 
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!"
 
36:17.2
 
36:18.0
 
I thought you'd never
come home!
 
36:18.0
 
36:18.8
 
I thought you'd
never come home!
 
36:18.9
 
36:19.8
 
I thought you'd never
come home!
 
36:19.8
 
36:20.7
 
I thought you'd
never come home!
 
36:20.7
 
36:21.7
 
"I didn't know what to do!
You know what?
 
36:21.8
 
36:22.8
 
I don't know how to
operate a can opener!
 
36:22.9
 
36:24.0
 
I don't know how to
operate a can opener!
 
36:24.0
 
36:24.9
 
I didn't know what
to do, man!
 
36:24.9
 
36:26.0
 
Push it down?
I couldn't think!
 
36:26.0
 
36:27.1
 
You know what?
You know what I did?
 
36:27.1
 
36:29.2
 
I took a can of dog food
and rolled it down the hill
 
36:29.2
 
36:30.3
 
and hoped a truck
ran it over!
 
36:30.4
 
36:31.6
 
That's all I could
think of, man.
 
36:37.8
 
36:40.5
 
I mean,
 
36:40.6
 
36:43.4
 
they'll do that even
if you just forgot your hat!
 
36:43.5
 
36:44.4
 
You come back in
eight seconds.
 
36:44.5
 
36:45.2
 
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!
 
36:45.2
 
36:46.9
 
I thought you'd
never come home!
 
36:46.9
 
36:48.0
 
I was gonna eat the bird!
 
36:48.0
 
36:49.2
 
I couldn't find the bird!
Where the fuck's the bird?
 
36:50.8
 
36:53.1
 
Will you stop it?
I was just here!"
 
36:55.9
 
36:58.4
 
God, they get you
mad sometimes!
 
36:58.5
 
36:59.4
 
Don't they?
 
36:59.4
 
37:01.4
 
Do you ever get
mad at your dog?
 
37:01.5
 
37:03.2
 
You feel really dumb when
you get all the way to work
 
37:03.3
 
37:06.8
 
and you're still pissed
at your pet!
 
37:06.8
 
37:07.8
 
What's the matter, Dan?
 
37:07.9
 
37:08.8
 
Well, the dog...
 
37:08.8
 
37:12.1
 
Goddamn it!
Never mind!
 
37:12.2
 
37:16.0
 
He chewed the legs
off everything!
 
37:16.0
 
37:17.9
 
OK,
I'll see you at lunch!
 
37:25.4
 
37:26.4
 
Dog don't care.
 
37:26.4
 
37:28.2
 
He'll do whatever was next!
 
37:28.2
 
37:30.6
 
He don't know what's next,
but he'll do something!
 
37:30.7
 
37:33.8
 
They'll do things in a row
that don't go together!
 
37:33.8
 
37:35.2
 
Have you ever seen a dog
walking through a room
 
37:35.2
 
37:36.1
 
and suddenly he stops
 
37:36.1
 
37:38.4
 
and chews his back
for 18 minutes?
 
37:42.6
 
37:43.8
 
And then when he's
finished chewing
 
37:43.8
 
37:47.0
 
as if it was scheduled
for right then!
 
37:47.0
 
37:47.9
 
When he's finished,
 
37:48.0
 
37:51.4
 
he doesn't even know
where he was gonna go!
 
37:51.5
 
37:53.4
 
Where was I gonna go?
 
37:53.4
 
37:54.4
 
Oh, shit!
 
37:54.5
 
37:56.7
 
Oh, I think I'll
go over here!
 
37:56.7
 
37:59.5
 
Oh, this is nice
over here.
 
37:59.5
 
38:02.2
 
I think I'll keep
coming over here!
 
38:02.2
 
38:03.8
 
He don't know.
He don't care!
 
38:03.8
 
38:05.4
 
Dog don't care!
 
38:05.5
 
38:07.3
 
Like I said,
he'll do anything.
 
38:07.4
 
38:10.9
 
He might embarrass you.
 
38:11.0
 
38:13.6
 
He might do something
inappropriate
 
38:13.6
 
38:15.8
 
when you have company.
 
38:15.9
 
38:18.8
 
You might have some
folks in visiting you.
 
38:18.8
 
38:21.5
 
Some of them you
don't know that well
 
38:21.6
 
38:23.2
 
trying to impress
a couple of them.
 
38:23.2
 
38:24.7
 
Hey, you might be
trying to borrow money
 
38:24.7
 
38:27.3
 
off one of these studs!
 
38:27.3
 
38:28.6
 
Dog's lying out there
in the living room,
 
38:28.6
 
38:29.7
 
you got all these
people sitting 'round,
 
38:29.7
 
38:30.7
 
you got little chips,
little dip.
 
38:30.7
 
38:32.7
 
Dog's in full view
of everyone!
 
38:32.7
 
38:34.4
 
Got carrot sticks,
salty sticks, ladyfingers,
 
38:34.4
 
38:36.7
 
finger ladies, all sort of
little things that you got.
 
38:36.7
 
38:38.4
 
Everybody is eating nicely,
 
38:38.5
 
38:39.8
 
and you look down
and you realize
 
38:39.8
 
38:43.5
 
that the dog is
licking his balls!
 
38:53.1
 
38:55.3
 
Nobody says anything!
 
38:55.3
 
38:56.6
 
No one mentions it!
 
38:56.6
 
38:59.6
 
Spectacular thing going on!
 
38:59.7
 
39:02.1
 
Hey, if I could reach,
I'd never leave the house!
 
39:02.1
 
39:03.7
 
Are you kidding me?
 
39:05.4
 
39:07.6
 
Poor little guy!
He didn't mean it!
 
39:07.7
 
39:09.4
 
He didn't mean it!
 
39:09.5
 
39:12.1
 
He'll come - 
He'll apologize to you!
 
39:12.1
 
39:15.0
 
He'll come around a few
hours later and apologize.
 
39:15.0
 
39:16.9
 
He'll give you that
doggy look.
 
39:17.8
 
39:19.1
 
Give you them eyes,
you know.
 
39:19.1
 
39:21.1
 
They have such a
great expression.
 
39:21.2
 
39:21.9
 
Almost human!
 
39:21.9
 
39:22.7
 
Sometimes we say,
"Isn't he...
 
39:22.7
 
39:25.4
 
Look! He's almost
human, Dan!
 
39:25.5
 
39:26.5
 
They do.
 
39:26.6
 
39:29.4
 
They look like they know
something about your mother.
 
39:30.5
 
39:33.1
 
They're not willing to
mention it right away!
 
39:33.1
 
39:34.7
 
He's looking at you like
they got a trig problem
 
39:34.7
 
39:35.8
 
they can't quite solve.
 
39:35.9
 
39:38.8
 
There is a...there's a
sad look in their eyes.
 
39:38.9
 
39:41.2
 
All the sadness
in the world
 
39:41.3
 
39:43.4
 
is right in the eyes
of the dog.
 
39:43.4
 
39:44.4
 
Do you ever do this?
 
39:44.5
 
39:46.2
 
Look right into your
doggie's eyes
 
39:46.3
 
39:49.0
 
and think of something
really sad,
 
39:49.1
 
39:53.6
 
and it will look like it's
happening to your dog!
 
39:53.7
 
39:54.9
 
The strangest thing!
 
39:54.9
 
39:56.9
 
The'll look at you
like that.
 
39:56.9
 
39:59.6
 
You know why they have
so successful a look?
 
39:59.6
 
40:01.9
 
'Cause they got eyebrows!
 
40:01.9
 
40:04.0
 
Dogs have eyebrows,
 
40:04.1
 
40:07.5
 
or at least little ridges
that pass for eyebrows.
 
40:07.5
 
40:10.2
 
They got little things
 
40:10.3
 
40:15.3
 
that they can manipulate
just like we do.
 
40:15.3
 
40:18.2
 
Oh, please.
 
40:18.2
 
40:26.5
 
Please, daddy,
one more treat.
 
40:30.5
 
40:32.3
 
Cats can't look
at you like that!
 
40:32.3
 
40:36.4
 
Cats look at you coldly as
if they're testing new eyes.
 
40:43.5
 
40:46.6
 
The reason cats look different,
cats don't have eyebrows!
 
40:46.7
 
40:50.0
 
Cats have a bunch of shit
sticking out of their heads!
 
40:50.1
 
40:53.3
 
They thought it was
gonna be an eyebrow,
 
40:53.3
 
40:55.8
 
but it didn't work out!
 
40:55.8
 
40:58.5
 
Let's not tell them!
They think it's an eyebrow!
 
40:58.6
 
41:03.3
 
It's just a bunch of shit
sticking out of their heads!
 
41:03.4
 
41:05.9
 
Cats are all different!
 
41:05.9
 
41:08.0
 
They do everything
different than a doggie!
 
41:08.0
 
41:11.0
 
Cats are cute!
Cats are goddamn cute!
 
41:11.0
 
41:11.7
 
Isn't he cute?
 
41:11.8
 
41:13.3
 
Look at them!
God, he's cute!
 
41:13.4
 
41:14.9
 
He's a kitty-cat!
 
41:14.9
 
41:17.4
 
That's how cute they are!
They needed two names!
 
41:17.4
 
41:18.4
 
Kitty wasn't cute enough.
 
41:18.4
 
41:19.8
 
Kitty-cat!
 
41:19.9
 
41:20.9
 
Isn't he cute,
the kitty-cat?
 
41:20.9
 
41:21.8
 
Look at him!
Isn't he cute?
 
41:21.8
 
41:25.5
 
Let's drown him!
 
41:25.5
 
41:26.9
 
Ain't he a little
goddamn kitty-cat?
 
41:26.9
 
41:27.9
 
Ain't he, look!
 
41:28.0
 
41:29.1
 
Stick him on the wall.
See if he hangs up there!
 
41:29.2
 
41:30.7
 
Whoa!
 
41:30.7
 
41:32.1
 
Good goddamn kitty-cat!
 
41:32.2
 
41:34.9
 
They're so goddamn cute
when they're teeny.
 
41:34.9
 
41:36.7
 
I hope they stay
that size forever.
 
41:36.7
 
41:38.0
 
He's darling!
 
41:38.0
 
41:38.8
 
Isn't he wonderful?
 
41:38.8
 
41:39.9
 
Cute little goddamn
kitty-cat!
 
41:39.9
 
41:41.8
 
They can jump
anyway they want!
 
41:41.8
 
41:42.6
 
When they're teeny,
 
41:42.7
 
41:44.4
 
they can jump straight
up in the air
 
41:44.5
 
41:45.6
 
without a run!
 
41:45.6
 
41:46.7
 
They just go...
 
41:49.2
 
41:51.3
 
They can even jump
backwards to the side!
 
41:53.3
 
41:54.6
 
How do they do that?
Holy shit!
 
41:54.7
 
41:56.1
 
They can do anything!
 
41:56.1
 
41:57.4
 
Jump and be cute
as can be!
 
41:57.4
 
41:59.3
 
Cute goddamn kitty-cat!
Isn't he cute?
 
41:59.3
 
42:00.6
 
God I love them.
They're so cute!
 
42:00.7
 
42:02.8
 
They're even cute
when they kill!
 
42:02.8
 
42:05.4
 
Hey, look!
He's playing with a mouse!
 
42:05.5
 
42:07.4
 
Bullshit!
 
42:07.4
 
42:12.3
 
Mouse doesn't
feel that way!
 
42:12.4
 
42:13.9
 
They're cute.
Oh, he's so precious
 
42:13.9
 
42:18.5
 
just tearing the throat
right out of that bird!
 
42:18.5
 
42:19.7
 
Cute as can be!
They kill.
 
42:19.7
 
42:21.3
 
See they like to
kill somethin'.
 
42:21.3
 
42:22.1
 
That's what they
want to do.
 
42:22.2
 
42:23.9
 
That's why they
act so nice!
 
42:23.9
 
42:26.1
 
They wanna go...
 
42:26.2
 
42:28.4
 
Even when they're teeny!
When they're just born!
 
42:28.4
 
42:29.5
 
You take a baby-baby!
 
42:29.6
 
42:30.5
 
That is, a human...
 
42:30.5
 
42:32.3
 
You take a baby dog
and a baby cat
 
42:32.3
 
42:34.4
 
and you attack all
three of them
 
42:34.4
 
42:37.5
 
which I try never to
do if I can help it,
 
42:37.6
 
42:39.2
 
but you get three
different results.
 
42:39.2
 
42:41.2
 
You attack a baby,
he cries.
 
42:41.3
 
42:43.0
 
You attack a puppy,
he cowers!
 
42:43.0
 
42:46.2
 
You attack a kitty-cat,
he fights!
 
42:46.2
 
42:47.9
 
One day old, they're
looking for some shit.
 
42:49.5
 
42:50.4
 
They ain't even have
their eyes open!
 
42:50.5
 
42:51.7
 
They'll grab anything.
 
42:53.9
 
42:55.9
 
Nasty little cute thing.
 
42:55.9
 
42:57.6
 
Cute little nasty guy!
 
42:57.7
 
42:59.5
 
Oh, they're wonderful,
God, I love them!
 
42:59.5
 
43:00.6
 
They're so physical.
 
43:00.7
 
43:03.0
 
That's what's fun.
They're so physical!
 
43:03.1
 
43:05.8
 
They love to rub on you!
They love to rub on you.
 
43:05.9
 
43:07.5
 
If you've got a leg,
and a cat,
 
43:07.5
 
43:08.8
 
you've got a party!
 
43:08.9
 
43:12.5
 
Oh boy! Oh boy!
Oh boy!
 
43:12.5
 
43:14.0
 
I love his leg,
oh boy!
 
43:14.0
 
43:16.4
 
I'm rubbing on his leg,
oh boy!
 
43:16.4
 
43:17.7
 
If you've got two legs,
shit!
 
43:17.8
 
43:19.7
 
Jubilee celebration time!
 
43:19.7
 
43:21.2
 
Oh boy! Two legs!
Hot shit!
 
43:21.3
 
43:22.4
 
I can do the figure eight!
 
43:22.4
 
43:23.6
 
They love to do
the figure eight!
 
43:23.6
 
43:24.8
 
Oh boy, oh boy!
 
43:24.8
 
43:26.8
 
I love to rub on his leg!
 
43:26.8
 
43:29.3
 
They'll rub against your leg
even if you're not there yet!
 
43:29.4
 
43:31.2
 
You may still be 50
feet down the hall!
 
43:31.2
 
43:32.1
 
They see you coming:
 
43:32.1
 
43:34.4
 
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!
 
43:34.4
 
43:37.0
 
Soon I'll be rubbing
on his leg!
 
43:37.0
 
43:38.9
 
They'll even move on sideways
so they don't miss you!
 
43:38.9
 
43:41.8
 
Oh, boy! Oh boy!
 
43:41.8
 
43:43.9
 
They love it.
They're so physical.
 
43:43.9
 
43:45.3
 
You don't have to pet a cat.
 
43:45.4
 
43:46.4
 
You just put your
hand over,
 
43:46.4
 
43:48.5
 
and he'll do all
the work, man.
 
43:52.3
 
43:55.0
 
Have you ever petted a cat
who's lying absolutely flat?
 
43:55.0
 
43:56.2
 
Before you're
halfway finished,
 
43:56.2
 
44:00.0
 
hiss ass is way up
in the air!
 
44:00.0
 
44:03.2
 
Like you pressed the
ass-button or something!
 
44:03.3
 
44:07.0
 
Isn't he a cute little...
Holy shit!
 
44:07.0
 
44:11.5
 
How did he do that?
 
44:11.5
 
44:12.8
 
Then they jump on
your chest
 
44:12.8
 
44:15.5
 
and put their ass
right in your face!
 
44:16.8
 
44:19.1
 
Here's my ass, dad!
 
44:19.2
 
44:22.1
 
Check this ass, huh?
 
44:22.1
 
44:23.3
 
And while they're
showing you their ass,
 
44:23.3
 
44:24.9
 
they give you
some of this stuff.
 
44:31.0
 
44:33.1
 
I say get him
off of me!
 
44:33.1
 
44:34.8
 
Jesus, I hate that!
 
44:34.9
 
44:38.4
 
I don't even know what it
is and I don't like it!
 
44:38.5
 
44:40.7
 
Looks like they're
into some bad drug!
 
44:43.9
 
44:51.0
 
There's one other quality
cats have which I admire.
 
44:51.0
 
44:53.6
 
Cats don't accept blame.
 
44:53.7
 
44:56.2
 
They don't
embarrass at all.
 
44:56.3
 
44:57.7
 
Cats do something dumb.
 
44:57.7
 
45:00.0
 
They don't know you've
been looking at them.
 
45:00.0
 
45:01.9
 
Dog knocks over a lamp,
 
45:02.0
 
45:04.3
 
you can tell who did it just
by looking at the dog.
 
45:06.4
 
45:07.3
 
Not the cat!
 
45:07.4
 
45:08.9
 
Cat doesn't
accept any blame.
 
45:09.0
 
45:12.5
 
Cat moves along to
the next activity.
 
45:12.5
 
45:13.4
 
What's that?
Not me.
 
45:13.5
 
45:15.3
 
Fuck that!
I'm a cat.
 
45:18.1
 
45:20.9
 
Something break?
Ask the dog.
 
45:25.6
 
45:27.2
 
Cat doesn't get
embarrassed.
 
45:27.3
 
45:28.8
 
Have you seen a cat
race across the carpet
 
45:28.8
 
45:30.6
 
and crash into
a glass door?
 
45:31.6
 
45:35.0
 
I meant that, I meant that,
I meant that.
 
45:35.0
 
45:37.8
 
That's exactly how
I wanted that to look!
 
45:41.2
 
45:42.7
 
Fucking me-ow!
 
45:44.0
 
45:45.6
 
Fucking me-ow!
 
45:46.8
 
45:48.2
 
Fucking me-ow!
 
45:50.2
 
45:54.5
 
That's what they say when
they get behind the couch.
 
45:54.5
 
45:58.1
 
A cat's too proud to
let you see him suffer.
 
45:58.2
 
45:59.2
 
If you look
behind the couch,
 
45:59.2
 
46:00.9
 
you'll find your
cat recuperating
 
46:01.0
 
46:04.1
 
from a domestic accident.
 
46:04.1
 
46:06.8
 
They got little slings
and walkers, you know.
 
46:10.0
 
46:12.5
 
Tried to make the
window from the lamp!
 
46:20.2
 
46:24.3
 
Little kitty-cat!
Goddamn kitty-cat!
 
46:24.3
 
46:28.6
 
Do you realize Hitler
only had one ball?
 
46:28.7
 
46:29.9
 
What do you think
about a man with one ball?
 
46:29.9
 
46:32.8
 
Do you think he has
two strikes against him?
 
46:36.2
 
46:40.4
 
Maybe he's got one ball
and two strikes!
 
46:40.5
 
46:42.0
 
Hitler only had one ball!
 
46:42.1
 
46:43.8
 
A lot of people
don't know that!
 
46:43.8
 
46:44.4
 
A lot of people don't
know that.
 
46:44.5
 
46:45.5
 
They say,
"Hitler, geez!
 
46:45.5
 
46:47.5
 
He had a lot of balls!"
 
46:50.8
 
46:53.2
 
One!
 
46:53.2
 
46:55.7
 
Sometimes I was trying to get
a list of words together
 
46:55.7
 
46:58.5
 
that would fairly
represent the dirty words!
 
46:58.5
 
47:01.1
 
'cause nobody gives you
a list of dirty words!
 
47:01.2
 
47:03.0
 
In life.
Have you noticed that?
 
47:04.0
 
47:05.2
 
There's some words that
are perfectly clean
 
47:05.2
 
47:06.7
 
but sound like they
could be filthy
 
47:06.7
 
47:09.4
 
if you gave them
just a little help.
 
47:09.4
 
47:13.2
 
A word like pussyfoot.
 
47:13.2
 
47:14.3
 
It's perfectly clean!
 
47:14.4
 
47:18.0
 
But when you say pussyfoot,
there's a little giggle!
 
47:18.1
 
47:19.5
 
'Cause people know that
with a little help
 
47:19.6
 
47:22.8
 
this word could be filthy!
 
47:22.8
 
47:24.4
 
No matter what form
of the verb you try.
 
47:24.4
 
47:26.2
 
It's clean as a verb.
 
47:26.3
 
47:30.4
 
But pussyfoot
could be a noun.
 
47:30.5
 
47:33.2
 
It could be a noun.
Pussyfoot.
 
47:33.3
 
47:38.4
 
A rare disorder!
 
47:38.4
 
47:41.7
 
Female birth defect!
 
47:41.8
 
47:44.9
 
Hello, boys.
 
47:44.9
 
47:49.8
 
I have pussyfoot!
 
47:49.8
 
47:53.0
 
God, you sure do, lady!
 
47:53.0
 
47:58.1
 
And I love them open-toed
shoes you have on!
 
47:58.1
 
48:00.5
 
Well, I'd rather have
pussyfoot than woodpecker.
 
48:00.5
 
48:02.6
 
I can say that...
 
48:05.6
 
48:07.3
 
Or beer nuts.
 
48:09.9
 
48:13.4
 
God, that must be awful!
 
48:13.4
 
48:15.2
 
Beer nuts!
 
48:15.2
 
48:20.9
 
The official disease
of Milwaukee!
 
48:20.9
 
48:23.8
 
I know whenever I see the
little canister behind the bar
 
48:23.8
 
48:27.6
 
I drop in a couple of
dollars for beer nuts.
 
48:27.6
 
48:31.1
 
I think we need a lot more
research on beer nuts
 
48:31.1
 
48:36.1
 
or cotton balls
 
48:36.1
 
48:43.2
 
which is the dreaded
final stage of beer nuts!
 
48:43.2
 
48:46.7
 
When my beer nuts
turn to cotton balls
 
48:46.8
 
48:50.1
 
I'll be heading home
to you!
 
48:50.1
 
48:53.1
 
It's an old Southern hymn!
 
48:53.1
 
48:54.4
 
There are lots of little
phrases like that
 
48:54.5
 
48:58.0
 
in the language that don't
quite say what they mean.
 
48:58.0
 
49:01.8
 
Take a shit
is another one!
 
49:01.9
 
49:03.7
 
Take a shit?
 
49:03.7
 
49:07.9
 
You don't take a shit!
You leave a shit!
 
49:07.9
 
49:10.5
 
That's the whole idea!
 
49:10.5
 
49:11.9
 
To leave it!
 
49:19.4
 
49:20.3
 
I left a shit!
 
49:20.4
 
49:25.4
 
Fine.
Thank you, Jeff!
 
49:25.4
 
49:25.9
 
Where did you leave it?
 
49:26.0
 
49:27.7
 
In the icebox!
 
49:31.7
 
49:33.0
 
I'm gonna take a shit!
 
49:33.0
 
49:37.8
 
Don't take one of mine!
 
49:37.8
 
49:43.7
 
I only have two left and
the weekend is coming up!
 
49:43.7
 
49:47.7
 
Why don't you go home and
take one of your own shits?
 
49:47.7
 
49:51.1
 
Guy's always
mooching off me!
 
49:51.1
 
49:54.8
 
He must think I'm made
of shit or something!
 
49:54.8
 
49:59.9
 
Well, that shit don't
grow in trees, you know!
 
49:59.9
 
50:01.8
 
Well, enough of that shit!
 
50:06.8
 
50:08.4
 
Lots of little
phrases like that!
 
50:08.4
 
50:10.0
 
Pick your nose or
blow your nose!
 
50:10.0
 
50:13.9
 
Blow your nose
is a phrase.
 
50:14.0
 
50:15.8
 
Imagine that.
 
50:15.9
 
50:18.1
 
Blowing your nose!
 
50:23.8
 
50:26.2
 
I don't believe they
really mean that, do you?
 
50:26.3
 
50:27.3
 
You can't blow your nose.
 
50:27.4
 
50:30.7
 
I believe it's
physically impossible
 
50:30.8
 
50:33.1
 
to blow your nose.
 
50:33.2
 
50:40.0
 
You might get somebody
else to blow your nose!
 
50:40.1
 
50:44.0
 
But it would have to
be a real good friend!
 
50:44.1
 
50:47.0
 
Cocktails...
 
50:47.0
 
50:49.3
 
Another clean word.
 
50:49.3
 
50:50.4
 
You can advertise
 
50:50.4
 
50:52.4
 
and you can put up
signs all over town!
 
50:52.4
 
50:54.5
 
Cocktails!
 
50:54.6
 
50:57.3
 
Long as you use both
halves of the word,
 
50:57.4
 
50:58.8
 
perfectly fine!
 
50:58.8
 
51:00.7
 
But you can't advertise either
one of those two items
 
51:00.7
 
51:03.2
 
if your break those
words in half.
 
51:03.2
 
51:06.2
 
They'll come and
take your sign down!
 
51:06.3
 
51:08.1
 
Cocktail!
It's OK!
 
51:08.1
 
51:09.8
 
It depends on how you
say that kind of word!
 
51:09.8
 
51:12.7
 
You ladies like
some cocktails?
 
51:12.8
 
51:15.0
 
Hey, lady!
 
51:15.0
 
51:17.5
 
You want a cocktail?
 
51:23.3
 
51:24.1
 
Cockpit.
 
51:24.2
 
51:25.0
 
Men don't like to
laugh about that!
 
51:25.1
 
51:29.2
 
Cockpit. Get it?
Oh, yeah.
 
51:29.3
 
51:32.4
 
Bangkok.
 
51:32.4
 
51:35.3
 
There's a lovely city!
 
51:35.3
 
51:40.2
 
How would you like to
be a hooker in Bangkok?
 
51:40.3
 
51:43.7
 
Would seem like a
natural habitat!
 
51:43.7
 
51:45.4
 
Peacock!
 
51:45.5
 
51:48.8
 
NBC is really proud
of their peacock!
 
51:48.8
 
51:50.8
 
Do you know what a
female peacock is?
 
51:50.9
 
51:52.6
 
A peacunt!
 
51:56.6
 
51:58.0
 
So my list,
 
51:58.0
 
51:59.7
 
I just was trying to
isolate the words
 
51:59.7
 
52:01.0
 
that are always filthy,
 
52:01.0
 
52:03.0
 
not the ones that were
sometimes dirty!
 
52:03.0
 
52:04.2
 
And the original list
was shit, piss,
 
52:04.2
 
52:05.8
 
fuck, cunt, cocksucker,
motherfucker and tits.
 
52:05.9
 
52:08.1
 
This is all I could
think of in one sitting!
 
52:08.1
 
52:10.8
 
Just one try!
 
52:10.9
 
52:11.8
 
Well, we had to add a few.
 
52:11.8
 
52:13.5
 
We had shit, piss,
fuck, cunt, cocksucker,
 
52:13.5
 
52:14.4
 
motherfucker, tits
 
52:14.4
 
52:18.3
 
and then we added
fart, turd and twat
 
52:18.3
 
52:20.0
 
which also don't have
other meanings, you know,
 
52:20.1
 
52:22.6
 
twat's twat,
and that's that!
 
52:26.3
 
52:27.5
 
But after a while,
it didn't take long.
 
52:27.6
 
52:28.5
 
Well, it took
quite awhile but
 
52:28.5
 
52:30.3
 
I finally discovered
that there were only
 
52:30.3
 
52:32.7
 
two words on the list 
that really had to deal with,
 
52:32.8
 
52:35.9
 
to sort of to look at
the double standard
 
52:36.0
 
52:39.1
 
that television uses where
language is concerned.
 
52:39.1
 
52:42.1
 
The two words
were fart and fuck.
 
52:42.1
 
52:43.3
 
Those are the only two.
 
52:43.3
 
52:45.3
 
They seem similar 'cause you
can't say either one of them.
 
52:45.3
 
52:48.3
 
You can't say fart
and you can't say fuck.
 
52:48.4
 
52:51.8
 
No matter how cleverly
you try to work them in
 
52:51.9
 
52:54.2
 
no matter how clinical
the conversation is.
 
52:54.3
 
52:56.8
 
Fart and fuck will not
show up on the final take.
 
52:56.9
 
52:58.8
 
You simply cannot say them.
 
52:58.8
 
53:00.1
 
But that's where
the similarity ends
 
53:00.1
 
53:01.5
 
'cause at least
for the word fuck
 
53:01.5
 
53:04.1
 
even though you can't
say the word fuck,
 
53:04.1
 
53:06.2
 
you can talk
about fucking,
 
53:06.2
 
53:08.1
 
or you can refer
to fucking.
 
53:08.2
 
53:11.0
 
There's lot of fuck-talk
going on on TV!
 
53:11.0
 
53:12.3
 
They just don't
call it fucking!
 
53:12.4
 
53:15.5
 
That's the secret!
They don't use that word!
 
53:15.5
 
53:16.6
 
There's plenty
of fuck-talk!
 
53:16.6
 
53:18.5
 
Have you seen people who
wrote a book about fucking?
 
53:18.6
 
53:20.8
 
You've seen a guy in a talk
show wrote a book about fucking!
 
53:20.8
 
53:22.2
 
How to fuck, who to fuck,
when to fuck,
 
53:22.3
 
53:25.3
 
what to fuck, and how
to feel after you fuck!
 
53:25.3
 
53:27.2
 
This man is a fuck expert,
 
53:27.3
 
53:28.3
 
and he wrote a fuck book
 
53:28.3
 
53:31.4
 
and he's talking to
Merv Griffin about fucking!
 
53:31.4
 
53:32.2
 
And they're getting
away with it
 
53:32.2
 
53:35.5
 
'cause they don't
call it fucking!
 
53:35.5
 
53:36.6
 
Same with the soap operas,
 
53:36.6
 
53:38.1
 
everybody, you take a
look at the soap opera.
 
53:38.1
 
53:40.2
 
You know, everybody
is fucking somebody
 
53:40.2
 
53:41.8
 
on a soap opera!
 
53:41.8
 
53:42.9
 
If they're not
fucking somebody
 
53:42.9
 
53:45.2
 
they're trying to
fuck somebody!
 
53:45.2
 
53:46.1
 
Will he fuck her?
Did he fuck her?
 
53:46.1
 
53:47.0
 
Has he fucked her?
Should he fuck her?
 
53:47.0
 
53:47.9
 
Can he fuck her
some more?
 
53:48.0
 
53:48.9
 
Will they fuck too much?
 
53:48.9
 
53:50.4
 
Will they get
silly from fucking?
 
53:50.5
 
53:52.1
 
Who's fucking who?
That's all you wanna know!
 
53:52.2
 
53:55.1
 
Is what the fuck is going
on on this program here?
 
53:55.2
 
53:58.7
 
You know that somebody
is getting fucked
 
53:58.7
 
54:03.4
 
and you think it's you!
 
54:03.4
 
54:04.7
 
So there's lot of fuck-talk
 
54:04.7
 
54:06.0
 
and there's plenty of
fucking on television.
 
54:06.0
 
54:08.6
 
They just don't
call it fucking!
 
54:08.6
 
54:10.8
 
They call it
everything else!
 
54:10.8
 
54:13.7
 
Now, on the other hand,
farts
 
54:13.7
 
54:16.9
 
not only can you not
mention the word fart
 
54:17.0
 
54:20.4
 
but you can't refer
to farts at all!
 
54:20.4
 
54:23.4
 
That's how bad farts are!
 
54:23.4
 
54:29.1
 
They're worse than fucking!
 
54:29.2
 
54:31.2
 
You never hear anybody
talking about farts on TV!
 
54:31.2
 
54:33.7
 
Never seen a guy who
wrote a book on farts.
 
54:33.7
 
54:34.5
 
How to fart,
who to fart,
 
54:34.5
 
54:36.9
 
and how to feel
after you fart!
 
54:36.9
 
54:39.1
 
There's no fart experts
on Merv Griffin show!
 
54:39.1
 
54:41.2
 
You don't see any farts
or fart references!
 
54:41.3
 
54:45.3
 
It's a fart-free zone!
 
54:45.4
 
54:46.8
 
Wouldn't you think
after 35 years
 
54:46.8
 
54:48.6
 
one guy by now
would have gone...
 
54:54.4
 
54:56.0
 
Just once!
 
54:56.0
 
54:57.4
 
Just once I'd like
to see someone on
 
54:57.5
 
54:59.2
 
the Johnny Carson panel
 
54:59.2
 
55:02.4
 
say, "Hey, Ed!
Move down, man!
 
55:07.5
 
55:10.4
 
That was a
Clydesdale fart!"
 
55:13.4
 
55:14.8
 
Well, anyway.
 
55:18.8
 
55:20.1
 
After a while,
I realized that I was
 
55:20.2
 
55:24.2
 
needlessly restricting
myself to seven words
 
55:24.2
 
55:27.7
 
and only to the ones that
weren't allowed on TV!
 
55:27.7
 
55:30.9
 
I mean, there were a
lot more to be looked at,
 
55:30.9
 
55:32.9
 
and television isn't the
only place that objects
 
55:32.9
 
55:34.8
 
to your language
sometimes.
 
55:34.8
 
55:36.6
 
There are lots
of situations
 
55:36.6
 
55:39.5
 
where you're not
supposed to say that
 
55:39.6
 
55:43.4
 
so I expanded the list
by as many as I could,
 
55:43.5
 
55:45.3
 
and I'd like to share
some with you now.
 
55:45.3
 
55:49.0
 
This list is a little longer
than it was before.
 
55:49.0
 
55:50.9
 
First we start with the
ones we already know:
 
55:50.9

59:23.4
 
59:25.6
 
riding the cotton pony,
dipping your wick,
